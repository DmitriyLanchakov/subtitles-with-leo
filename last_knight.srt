1
00:01:33,159 --> 00:01:35,360
Where in hell is
your so-called magician?

2
00:01:35,362 --> 00:01:37,096
He will be here,
Lancelot.

3
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:38,497
He swore it.

4
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:46,238
They're preparing
for a second wave.

5
00:01:55,149 --> 00:01:56,415
Charge!

6
00:02:06,326 --> 00:02:08,627
This... this is what
the end looks like.

7
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:34,686
Your so-called
magician, Merlin,
cannot help us.

8
00:02:34,688 --> 00:02:36,455
We're outnumbered,
100 to 1.

9
00:02:36,457 --> 00:02:37,923
How are we gonna
get out of this?

10
00:02:37,925 --> 00:02:39,458
He promised a weapon,
one of great power.

11
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:40,659
Arthur,
you are my king.

12
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:41,927
I will lay down
my life for you,

13
00:02:41,929 --> 00:02:44,630
but this Merlin
is no wizard.

14
00:02:45,231 --> 00:02:47,232
He's a worthless drunkard!

15
00:02:49,235 --> 00:02:52,571
Oh, god, I'm sozzled!

16
00:02:52,573 --> 00:02:54,339
One last nip.

17
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:11,223
<i> Magic does exist.</i>

18
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:13,759
<i> It was found, long ago,</i>

19
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:17,563
<i> inside a crashed alien ship.</i>

20
00:03:21,734 --> 00:03:23,602
Hello?

21
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:26,238
Hello!

22
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:27,973
It is I,

23
00:03:27,975 --> 00:03:32,778
conjurer of spirits,
master of the dark arts!

24
00:03:33,513 --> 00:03:35,347
Is anyone there?

25
00:03:36,683 --> 00:03:38,684
It is I, Merlin.

26
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:40,986
The wizard?

27
00:03:40,988 --> 00:03:43,255
Remember me?

28
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:52,231
No! I kept your secret!
I did! Just as I promised!

29
00:03:52,398 --> 00:03:55,234
I told no one of
your existence. No one!

30
00:03:55,368 --> 00:03:58,537
But you have
to understand,
we britons

31
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:00,606
are in a desperate fight.

32
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:03,275
End-of-times sort of thing.
I mean it.

33
00:04:03,277 --> 00:04:05,377
It's happening down there
now as we speak.

34
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:06,979
It's awful!

35
00:04:06,981 --> 00:04:10,716
Big personalities
just sort of clashing
and bloody.

36
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,021
I hate to ask...
But we need your help.

37
00:04:16,023 --> 00:04:18,490
There are no spells.
There is no magic.

38
00:04:18,492 --> 00:04:20,592
We retreat.
Live to fight another day.

39
00:04:20,594 --> 00:04:25,297
Without sacrifice...
There can be no victory.

40
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,299
This is madness!

41
00:04:27,301 --> 00:04:28,567
He will be here.

42
00:04:28,668 --> 00:04:30,802
All right,
i am what they say!

43
00:04:30,804 --> 00:04:34,706
I'm a liar, I'm a charlatan.
I've deceived my whole life.

44
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:37,342
But if I could,
for one moment,

45
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:39,378
change this world
for the better,

46
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:41,546
I would give up everything.
Everything!

47
00:04:41,714 --> 00:04:44,549
I'd give up drink,
money, wom...

48
00:04:44,817 --> 00:04:46,451
Drink and money.

49
00:04:46,753 --> 00:04:48,353
Look.

50
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:51,356
<i> Good men will die</i>
<i> without your help.</i>

51
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:53,358
<i> Women. Children.</i>

52
00:04:53,626 --> 00:04:57,396
I know your world
was destroyed. I'm sorry.

53
00:04:57,764 --> 00:05:00,465
But please
don't let ours die, too.

54
00:05:02,568 --> 00:05:03,835
I beg of you.

55
00:05:03,837 --> 00:05:10,709
Guardian knights, transform.
Dragon is yours to command.

56
00:05:10,711 --> 00:05:13,545
Oh. Yes.

57
00:05:13,547 --> 00:05:15,881
That would be
just the thing.

58
00:05:19,553 --> 00:05:21,520
Protect this staff.

59
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:25,424
One day a great evil
will come for it.

60
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:54,486
Oh, yes!

61
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:07,466
Charge!

62
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:28,620
<i> It has been said</i>

<i>Without leaders, chaos reigns.</i>

77
00:07:20,973 --> 00:07:22,774
<i> Two species at war.</i>

<i> One flesh, one metal.</i>

No, he's busy.
He's always busy.

85
00:07:44,631 --> 00:07:47,899
A mojito needs ice.

86
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,734
Ice!

87
00:07:49,736 --> 00:07:51,570
We are not animals.

This is the jam!
Ooh, I like this.

93
00:08:06,018 --> 00:08:07,752
Good choice.
Good choice.

94
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,555
Get it off my desk.

95
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:12,824
No way!

No, get the director

99

<i> Why?</i>

101
00:08:30,810 --> 00:08:32,878
Y'all want to see
some dead robots?

102
00:08:34,914 --> 00:08:38,083
You crazy?
This is an alien no-go zone.

103
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:42,754
Government doesn't
want us to go in here.

104
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:55,667
We're not
supposed to be here.

105
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:58,737
We're kids, man.
We get away with anything.

106
00:08:58,739 --> 00:09:00,038
Nah, man.

107
00:09:01,275 --> 00:09:02,674
I'm getting me
a souvenir.

108

Whoa, this is
the real deal.

109

There's
a dead one over there.

- Cool!
- Not cool.

111
00:09:12,786 --> 00:09:14,619
Trf shot 'em down.

112
00:09:14,621 --> 00:09:17,822
Whatever.
My dad says shoot 'em all
and let god sort 'em out.

113

Nah, bro.

118
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:27,899
Yeah,
it's totally dead.

119
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,601
He's definitely,
definitely dead.

120
00:09:29,603 --> 00:09:30,635
I know, right?

121
00:09:30,637 --> 00:09:32,971
Wait, guys.

Never look back!

All right,
go in there.

Damn. I almost had
a heart attack!

Relax.
We're covered.

What the...

141
00:11:23,917 --> 00:11:26,051
What happened
to your arm?

142
00:11:26,719 --> 00:11:28,086
Shot you?

143
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:29,721
Damn it!

144
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:32,691
He can't transform.

145
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:34,092
I'm trying to fix him.

146
00:11:34,094 --> 00:11:36,027
But you're being a baby
about it, sqweeks.

147
00:11:37,763 --> 00:11:39,898
It's all right.
You did good.

Wow. You have
a big heart...

149
00:11:43,469 --> 00:11:45,003
That seems to be working.

Canopy thing's pretty crazy.
It's none of your business.

00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:41,893
You kids gotta
get out of here.

164
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:43,828
"Kids"?
You're here.

165
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:45,029
I live here.

166
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:46,831
This is my home.

167
00:12:46,833 --> 00:12:49,234
What's this?
The living room or
the dining room?

168
00:12:49,236 --> 00:12:51,069
Someone's gotta
take care of 'em.

169
00:12:51,071 --> 00:12:52,504
I don't think so.

170
00:12:52,506 --> 00:12:54,873
They're scared.
They're lost.
Hurry.

171
00:12:54,974 --> 00:12:57,175
<i>- I've got a heat signature.</i>
<i>- Hostile intent is displayed.</i>

172
00:12:57,177 --> 00:13:00,545
<i>- On location 30 seconds.</i>
<i>- Am I cleared to fire?</i>

173
00:13:00,547 --> 00:13:03,114
No, place, no home, no family.
Do you know how that feels?

174
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:05,550
No, 'cause your asses got
big old houses to go home to.

175
00:13:05,552 --> 00:13:07,252
We got a condo.
Shh!

176
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:09,087
I love her.

177
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:15,560
<i> Alien has a weapon.</i>
Fire!

178
00:13:29,209 --> 00:13:32,310
He's down. Bravo team,
extract those kids.

179
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:33,545
We're moving out!

180
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,884
Get up.
I can't.

181
00:13:39,886 --> 00:13:41,586
No, no, no,
look at me.

182
00:13:41,588 --> 00:13:44,389
Wake up, canopy!
You're gonna be okay.

183
00:13:49,862 --> 00:13:52,363
I want to thank you.

184
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:56,367
Wake up, look at me.
Wake up, canopy.
I'm not leaving you.

185
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:58,102
You're all I have left!

186
00:14:00,239 --> 00:14:01,873
No, no, no.

187
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:09,414
Hey! It's all
i got in my bag of tricks,
so you might want to hop in.

188
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,360
Hey! Where are the keys?

189
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:23,928
Where are the keys?

190
00:14:23,930 --> 00:14:25,129
I'm just gonna
hotwire this bitch.

191
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:39,644
<i> I'm tired of people</i>
<i> messing with me.</i>

192
00:14:39,646 --> 00:14:40,945
It's over.

193
00:14:40,947 --> 00:14:43,047
No! I can fix him.

194
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,349
Nobody can fix him,
he's dead.

195
00:14:44,351 --> 00:14:47,085
Hey, look at me.
Would he want you
to die, too?

196
00:14:47,087 --> 00:14:48,319
Let's go, now.

197
00:14:52,958 --> 00:14:54,359
Come on, come on!

198
00:14:58,097 --> 00:15:00,398
Come on. Come on,
no time, let's go.

199
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:02,200
What? Hey,
you're that guy.

200
00:15:02,202 --> 00:15:03,368
No, I'm not that guy.

201
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:04,636
The one who saves
transformers.

202
00:15:04,638 --> 00:15:05,970
I thought you were
just a legend.

203
00:15:05,972 --> 00:15:07,038
Some legend.

204
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:10,174
Hey, you know
there's a reward
for turning you in.

205
00:15:10,176 --> 00:15:13,244
Cool. You want to get
punched in the face,
like, really hard?

206
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:15,146
No.

207
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:16,981
Good. Go.
Okay.

208
00:15:16,983 --> 00:15:18,182
You're such an idiot.

209
00:15:18,184 --> 00:15:20,451
See ya around, "legend."

210
00:15:20,953 --> 00:15:22,053
Sqweeks.

211
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,434
Oh!

212
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:39,070
Easy. Easy,
all right?

213
00:15:39,438 --> 00:15:40,939
I'm just here
to help you.

214
00:15:46,012 --> 00:15:47,478
Easy, buddy. Yeah.

215
00:15:49,249 --> 00:15:51,549
You're hurt really bad.
All right?

216
00:15:55,721 --> 00:15:58,222
Protect from quin...

217
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:01,326
I'm sorry.

218
00:16:03,362 --> 00:16:06,331
Take the...

219
00:16:07,433 --> 00:16:10,468
The talisman
will protect you.

220
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,070
Oh, you don't
owe me anything.

221
00:16:12,072 --> 00:16:14,305
<i> Seglass ni tonday.</i>

222
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:16,474
I can't. You keep it.

223
00:16:16,476 --> 00:16:18,142
Quin... quin...

224
00:16:22,481 --> 00:16:25,416
He didn't make it, bee.
I'm coming out solo.

225
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:29,454
This is turning
into one shitty-ass day.

226
00:17:03,222 --> 00:17:04,489
<i> Cyclops, eyeball kingfish.</i>

227
00:17:04,491 --> 00:17:06,157
<i> Flip ir to eo.</i>

228
00:17:08,293 --> 00:17:11,396
He's a positive match, sir.
It's Cade yeager.

229
00:17:13,132 --> 00:17:15,366
It's over.
Help yourself out here.

230
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:20,371
Where are the others?
The ones you're hiding.

231
00:17:21,106 --> 00:17:22,807
I don't sell out friends.

232
00:17:22,809 --> 00:17:24,108
"Friends."

233
00:17:24,243 --> 00:17:26,044
This is an invasion.

234
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:28,646
One day we wake up...
They're in charge.

235
00:17:29,248 --> 00:17:31,215
You see anybody in charge?

236
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,618
They just keep
falling out of the sky.

237
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:36,454
Something's coming,
and you can't shoot
your way out of it.

238
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:04,549
What was that?

239
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,350
That was a mistake.

240
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:27,438
Watch out,
watch out,
watch out!

241
00:18:48,393 --> 00:18:49,894
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

242
00:18:49,896 --> 00:18:51,863
<i> Next time</i>
<i> you shoot somebody,</i>

243
00:18:51,865 --> 00:18:54,532
<i>don't go near 'em</i>
<i>till you're sure they're dead.</i>

244
00:18:54,534 --> 00:18:56,434
Put the weapon down,
trust me!

245
00:18:56,436 --> 00:18:58,202
Easy, bee. Easy.

246
00:18:59,572 --> 00:19:03,207
<i>I'll burn you so bad</i>
<i>you'll wish</i>
<i>you'd died as a child.</i>

247
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:04,275
Shoot him!

248
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:06,344
You're dead before
i hit the ground.

249
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:08,479
I said stand down.
Shoot! Shoot!

250
00:19:09,681 --> 00:19:10,915
Take the shot!

251
00:19:10,917 --> 00:19:12,216
Shoot!

252
00:19:12,218 --> 00:19:13,451
Don't do it, bee!

253
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:16,420
Hold your fire!
Hold it!

254
00:19:16,422 --> 00:19:18,222
You! Drop it!

255
00:19:18,224 --> 00:19:20,158
I'm not dropping shit.

256
00:19:21,193 --> 00:19:22,260
Hey.

257
00:19:22,262 --> 00:19:25,396
The military
doesn't want it this way,
bee, you gotta believe that.

258
00:19:25,398 --> 00:19:28,533
It's a new world order
now and these guys are
calling the shots.

259
00:19:28,934 --> 00:19:30,568
All they want is a home,
and you know it.

260
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:33,271
You push them,
and they push right back.

261
00:19:34,339 --> 00:19:36,340
Hound's in town.

262
00:19:36,342 --> 00:19:38,376
Love starting the day off
with a gunfight.

263
00:19:38,477 --> 00:19:41,412
Sorry I'm late.
My invitation to
this ass-kicking

264
00:19:41,414 --> 00:19:43,447
must've got lost
in the mail!

265
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:45,917
Me and my crew are
rolling out of here.

266
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,252
- Call off your birds.
- Let's go.

267
00:19:50,389 --> 00:19:53,257
All right, star 1, abort.
Negative decepticon activity.

268
00:19:53,259 --> 00:19:56,294
Trf, stand fast.
Drop your guns.

269
00:19:56,395 --> 00:19:59,430
You sure you
don't want to shoot?
I'm a big ol' target.

270
00:19:59,565 --> 00:20:01,666
Wusses.

271
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:03,301
Whose side are you on?

272
00:20:03,303 --> 00:20:04,502
They're all bad.

273
00:20:04,504 --> 00:20:06,604
No, they're not.

274
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:09,407
Eagle eye, tag him.

275
00:20:14,279 --> 00:20:16,214
I've never seen
one like it, general.

276
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:20,284
This one's older,
older than optimus prime.

277
00:20:20,286 --> 00:20:23,554
Decepticon
barricade was spotted
at that same location.

278
00:20:28,428 --> 00:20:31,362
CIA's had him under
pred surveillance
for a while now.

279
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,405
Yeah, he's been keeping
some interesting company.

280
00:20:42,007 --> 00:20:43,808
<i>The staff is hidden on earth.</i>

281
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:46,611
<i> A weapon of ultimate power.</i>

282
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:48,613
<i> We'll find this staff.</i>

283
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:50,481
That voice.

284
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:52,550
I can hear it
in my nightmares.

285
00:20:52,552 --> 00:20:54,452
Megatron.
Waiting
for authentication.

286
00:20:54,454 --> 00:20:55,519
It's him.

287
00:20:55,521 --> 00:20:57,488
Lord Megatron.

288
00:20:57,656 --> 00:21:00,291
Get that out of my face.

289
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:01,659
Report.

290
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:04,528
Tell me you have
found the talisman.

291
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:07,598
I saw it. A dying knight
gave it to a human.

292
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,401
But there was too
much trf firepower.

293
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:12,837
You let the talisman
get away!

294
00:21:14,473 --> 00:21:16,641
We must have it!

295
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:19,777
Without the talisman,
we cannot find the staff!

296
00:21:20,045 --> 00:21:22,313
I know who can lead us
to it.

297
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:24,782
The trf.

298
00:21:25,550 --> 00:21:27,518
Commander in chief
wants that weapon,

299
00:21:27,653 --> 00:21:31,589
or "staff" as he calls it,
secured at all cost.

300
00:21:31,591 --> 00:21:34,492
Maintain your
covert embed with trf.

301
00:21:34,494 --> 00:21:36,761
Sir...
They just don't get it.

302
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:39,664
Our history with
bee and the autobots.

303
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:44,669
Oh, what we would all give
to have prime back right now.

304
00:21:45,504 --> 00:21:47,438
<i>Optimus prime.</i>

305
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:50,675
<i> Re-entry cybertron.</i>

306
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:15,466
My world!

307
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:19,370
What has happened to my world?

308
00:22:19,538 --> 00:22:21,806
Your world is dying.

309
00:22:24,443 --> 00:22:26,844
I've been waiting
for you, optimus.

310
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:28,813
Come meet your maker.

311
00:22:29,881 --> 00:22:32,750
You are my creator?

312
00:22:33,518 --> 00:22:37,121
I am quintessa,
the prime of life.

313
00:22:39,858 --> 00:22:42,493
What have you done
to my home?

314
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:49,633
I will kill you!

315
00:22:51,803 --> 00:22:54,438
You dare to strike
your god?

316
00:22:56,475 --> 00:22:59,543
Your war doomed
cybertron.

317
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,646
Megatron started the war!

318
00:23:04,449 --> 00:23:07,118
You destroyed
your world, you fool.

319
00:23:09,588 --> 00:23:11,956
My perfect creation.

320
00:23:12,591 --> 00:23:14,525
You're going
to fix it,

321
00:23:14,693 --> 00:23:18,462
or the race of
transformers
dies forever.

322
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:22,867
I made you.

323
00:23:23,468 --> 00:23:25,870
You are mine
to command.

324
00:23:36,481 --> 00:23:37,681
How did you
get in here?

325
00:23:50,495 --> 00:23:51,929
My lord,
that weird thing

326
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:54,799
we've been waiting for
1,600 years to happen...

327
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:57,802
I think it's really
happening this time!

328
00:24:06,545 --> 00:24:08,479
The knight has arrived.

329
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:11,482
The talisman
has been bestowed.

330
00:24:13,852 --> 00:24:16,854
At last, cogman.
It begins.

331
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:39,643
Mine!

332
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:50,554
Yes!

333
00:24:53,558 --> 00:24:55,626
Okay. Thanks.

334
00:24:55,961 --> 00:24:57,027
Whew!

335
00:24:57,963 --> 00:25:00,564
Wembly!
I was quite open.

336
00:25:00,566 --> 00:25:02,566
There's a reason
why you're always open.

337
00:25:02,568 --> 00:25:03,901
There's a reason
you're always single.

338
00:25:04,569 --> 00:25:05,903
What?
What?

339
00:25:07,506 --> 00:25:08,572
Idiot.

340
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:27,091
Oh, god. Okay.

341
00:25:27,592 --> 00:25:29,660
So late, so late, so late.

342
00:25:30,796 --> 00:25:36,901
484 ce. A desperate
last stand between
civilization and barbarism.

343
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:39,637
Two worlds colliding.

344
00:25:39,639 --> 00:25:41,605
Only one survives.

345
00:25:41,607 --> 00:25:43,607
Lancelot. Percival.

346
00:25:43,609 --> 00:25:44,808
King Arthur.

347
00:25:44,810 --> 00:25:46,310
Honorable men.

348
00:25:46,312 --> 00:25:49,547
Brave, muscles sinewed,

349
00:25:49,549 --> 00:25:51,715
sweat glistening
off their bodies.

350
00:25:51,850 --> 00:25:55,986
A few brave men
who were willing to
sacrifice all for victory.

351
00:25:55,988 --> 00:25:58,122
Sound too good
to be true, poppy?

352
00:25:58,590 --> 00:25:59,857
Because it's horseshit.

353
00:26:01,294 --> 00:26:06,597
A likely composite
of a Roman general
and a Celtic king.

354
00:26:06,599 --> 00:26:08,666
Our dragon.

355
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,968
Just a medieval catapult.

356
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:13,137
And then we have Merlin,

357
00:26:13,705 --> 00:26:14,972
our kingmaker.

358
00:26:15,106 --> 00:26:17,174
Probably never existed.

359
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:19,843
The question is,

360
00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:23,147
why? Why do we tell
ourselves these stories?

361
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:25,849
Other than the fact
that dragons are wicked.

362
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,853
It's because
we want to believe.

363
00:26:30,088 --> 00:26:32,957
Believe that we can be
heroes in our own lives.

364
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:35,659
When all seems lost,

365
00:26:35,794 --> 00:26:37,962
a few brave souls, us,

366
00:26:37,964 --> 00:26:40,130
can save everything
we've ever known.

367
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,100
Or is it just the dragons?

368
00:26:57,917 --> 00:26:59,083
Well,

369
00:26:59,985 --> 00:27:02,620
it won't be much longer
now, old friend.

370
00:27:02,887 --> 00:27:05,155
Signs of the end
are all around us.

371
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:08,626
You know what to do,
don't you?

372
00:27:10,061 --> 00:27:13,230
We must rebuild my home.

373
00:27:13,832 --> 00:27:17,701
There is a way
to heal your world.

374
00:27:17,836 --> 00:27:21,238
My power of creation,
the staff,

375
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:25,909
was stolen from me by
my 12 guardian knights.

376
00:27:26,177 --> 00:27:29,913
They betrayed me
and hid it on earth.

377
00:27:30,081 --> 00:27:33,017
<i> Gave it to</i>
<i> your precious humans.</i>

378
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:38,255
The staff is the only way
to bring life
back to cybertron.

379
00:27:38,723 --> 00:27:41,792
You are going
to find it for me.

380
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:45,029
Do you seek redemption,
prime?

381
00:27:46,064 --> 00:27:47,765
Do you?

382
00:27:47,767 --> 00:27:49,233
My maker,

383
00:27:49,968 --> 00:27:51,802
I do.

384
00:27:53,738 --> 00:27:58,208
No fear. No hate.
No anger.

385
00:27:59,744 --> 00:28:04,114
No fear. No hate.
No anger.

386
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:06,917
Get off, you maggot!

387
00:28:08,888 --> 00:28:11,188
I will kill you,
flying rat!

388
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:16,460
He's very little.
Very tiring.

389
00:28:16,462 --> 00:28:18,896
Losing our heads
sitting around here.

390
00:28:18,898 --> 00:28:20,964
So tired of hiding.

391
00:28:30,909 --> 00:28:34,044
Oh, hey, chief!
Wow, nice... ow.

392
00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:35,479
God!

393
00:28:35,481 --> 00:28:37,081
Nice horse you got there.

394
00:28:37,083 --> 00:28:39,116
You're really getting into
this whole Indian thing, huh?

395
00:28:40,018 --> 00:28:42,920
Don't call me chief.
My name is sherman.

396
00:28:42,922 --> 00:28:44,755
Aren't you
the tribal chief?

397
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:46,924
Yeah. But from you
it sounds...

398
00:28:46,926 --> 00:28:48,892
I don't know,
vaguely racist.

399
00:28:50,028 --> 00:28:52,129
My cruiser got stolen.
What?

400
00:28:52,497 --> 00:28:54,498
Again.
That's terrible!

401
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:55,799
You know what?

402
00:28:55,801 --> 00:28:56,934
Shit's getting
out of control.

403
00:28:56,936 --> 00:28:58,469
There's crime
going on everywhere!

404
00:28:58,471 --> 00:28:59,937
A bunch of my stuff
got stolen.

405
00:28:59,939 --> 00:29:02,806
Cut the shit, Cade...
And get me my car back.

406
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:15,953
Booyah! Big time.

407
00:29:16,154 --> 00:29:18,956
Been holding that one
in for a while.

408
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:21,191
Damn, forgot about
that cluster bomb.

409
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:23,093
Yo!

410
00:29:23,095 --> 00:29:24,161
What's
your problem, dude?

411
00:29:24,295 --> 00:29:25,796
Sqweeks!

412
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:28,766
Next time, ease
on the brakes!

413
00:29:28,768 --> 00:29:32,069
That's the way I roll.
I like to make a statement
when I arrive.

414
00:29:32,071 --> 00:29:34,104
Well, you're getting dust
all over the campus!

415
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:35,839
This ain't no campus.
It's a junkyard!

416
00:29:35,841 --> 00:29:38,008
Come on, hustle.
<i> Andale, andale!</i>

417
00:29:40,513 --> 00:29:44,047
Hey, don't take
any aggression out on me.

418
00:29:44,149 --> 00:29:46,784
Damn it, grimlock!
We're guests here!

419
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:49,119
You got in
some shit, huh?

420
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:50,320
Yeah, neck deep!

421
00:29:50,322 --> 00:29:54,258
Cade, that's what you get
for taking the yellow bugger.

422
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:57,127
You need a leader out
there... like me.

423
00:29:57,129 --> 00:29:59,096
<i> Shut up.</i>
<i> Before I do some damage</i>

424
00:29:59,230 --> 00:30:00,898
<i>you won't walk away from.</i>

425
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,866
You will never
be optimus prime.

426
00:30:02,868 --> 00:30:05,869
Come on, man.
Million-year-old
legendary warrior

427
00:30:05,871 --> 00:30:07,971
and you act like
a bunch of junkyard dogs!

428
00:30:07,973 --> 00:30:09,339
You're starting
to piss me off!

429
00:30:13,912 --> 00:30:15,946
<i> Ay, chihuahua!</i>

430
00:30:15,948 --> 00:30:17,848
Come back here,
grimlock!

431
00:30:17,850 --> 00:30:19,883
Turn around.
What do you got
in your mouth?

432
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:25,088
I swear,
i am wasting my time
protecting you.

433
00:30:25,090 --> 00:30:26,824
Drop the cruiser right now!

434
00:30:27,125 --> 00:30:29,126
I know you got
chief sherman's cruiser.

435
00:30:29,128 --> 00:30:30,294
Drop it!

436
00:30:31,162 --> 00:30:34,031
Serves you right.
Spit it out! Spit it!

437
00:30:34,033 --> 00:30:35,566
<i> Wow!</i>

438
00:30:44,943 --> 00:30:48,178
Don't eat cars.
Don't eat cars.

439
00:30:49,380 --> 00:30:52,015
You get back in your hole
and think about what you did.

440
00:30:52,116 --> 00:30:55,185
It's like
the Macy's Thanksgiving day
parade out here, Jimmy j.

441
00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:59,056
You hired me from a want ad
in the <i> Dakota penny ledger.</i>

442
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:01,358
Think that comes
with a superpower?

443
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:05,128
That is a dinosaur!
An alien dinosaur!

444
00:31:06,064 --> 00:31:07,598
That was not in the ad!

445
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:09,266
It tried to eat me
yesterday.

446
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,604
No, no, I don't want
to go to any prison.

447
00:31:13,606 --> 00:31:14,638
Well, that's where
you're gonna go, okay?

448
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,073
'Cause you're aiding
and abetting.

449
00:31:16,075 --> 00:31:18,342
I'm the big boss,
you're my little crimey.

450
00:31:18,344 --> 00:31:20,043
When you leave,

451
00:31:20,045 --> 00:31:22,012
it becomes
the <i> wild kingdom </i> out here.

452
00:31:22,014 --> 00:31:23,247
I don't know what to do.

453
00:31:23,249 --> 00:31:24,615
I told you,
this is a junkyard.

454
00:31:24,617 --> 00:31:29,152
You hired me to be
senior vice president
of worldwide operations.

455
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,154
Did I tell you that?
Yes, that's what you said.

456
00:31:31,156 --> 00:31:34,091
Do not take this title away
from me, Cade.

457
00:31:34,093 --> 00:31:36,226
This is not a startup, okay?
I don't do this shit
for money.

458
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:40,130
What's wrong with you?
How you gonna eat?

459
00:31:40,265 --> 00:31:41,899
What's he doing here?

460
00:31:47,038 --> 00:31:50,340
Ugh! Here comes the
most irritating, annoying
transformer on earth.

461
00:31:50,342 --> 00:31:51,408
Should I frag him?

462
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:53,243
What did he give you
to get past the gate?

463
00:31:53,245 --> 00:31:54,344
Nothing!

464
00:31:54,346 --> 00:31:56,380
Hey, Cade.
He gave him this.

465
00:31:57,048 --> 00:31:58,982
I've never seen that
before in my life.

466
00:31:58,984 --> 00:32:01,451
Come on, say it!
You wanted
the alien blaster.

467
00:32:01,453 --> 00:32:03,387
You said a big gun
makes a big man.

468
00:32:03,389 --> 00:32:05,455
Hey, you know human beings
lose their temper, right?

469
00:32:05,457 --> 00:32:07,424
Don't you dare!
Hey, hey!
Come here!

470
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:08,692
The worst
senior vice president...

471
00:32:08,694 --> 00:32:12,029
Yeah, you're real tough!
What, you been working out?

472
00:32:12,031 --> 00:32:14,298
I'm going to frag him.
Definitely frag him.

473
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,666
I heard that, hound.

474
00:32:15,668 --> 00:32:16,934
Easy!

475
00:32:16,936 --> 00:32:20,137
Oh, god. You always
resort to violence
right off the bat.

476
00:32:20,139 --> 00:32:23,674
Daytrader!
The hell are you
doing here?

477
00:32:23,676 --> 00:32:25,108
You find
our spaceship yet?

478
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:26,376
I'm getting tired of
hanging around here,

479
00:32:26,378 --> 00:32:30,347
Carbon monoxide, and
perhaps a small gasoline
drinking problem

480
00:32:30,349 --> 00:32:33,250
are gonna kill you
long before a bullet,
my corpulent comrade.

481
00:32:33,252 --> 00:32:35,085
Back off!
Get out of my face.
Watch it! Guys, stop!

482
00:32:35,087 --> 00:32:36,153
You want to throw
down with hound?

483
00:32:36,155 --> 00:32:37,421
Tough guy, huh? Rude.

484
00:32:37,722 --> 00:32:40,223
How about you trying to
carry all this stuff?

485
00:32:41,259 --> 00:32:42,693
Look what
i found in buffalo.

486
00:32:42,695 --> 00:32:45,162
Starscream's head,
ladies and gentlemen.

487
00:32:45,164 --> 00:32:47,130
Look what I got.
New voice box for bee.

488
00:32:47,132 --> 00:32:50,200
I only got
the good stuff, Cade.
Come on.

489
00:32:50,202 --> 00:32:52,536
You hear that, bee?
You're gonna talk, buddy!

490
00:32:54,707 --> 00:32:56,173
Get down, bee!

491
00:32:57,443 --> 00:32:59,242
All right,
what else you got?

492
00:32:59,244 --> 00:33:02,045
Where'd you get
that piece of junk?

493
00:33:02,047 --> 00:33:05,115
A knight of iacon
talisman in this dump?

494
00:33:05,283 --> 00:33:06,350
Nah, it's not real.

495
00:33:06,352 --> 00:33:07,751
Is it? No, definitely not.

496
00:33:07,753 --> 00:33:11,321
You think I don't know
what the hell this is?
How valuable?

497
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:13,056
But I know it's something,
because it's got you

498
00:33:13,058 --> 00:33:14,257
licking your chops,
you skank.

499
00:33:14,492 --> 00:33:16,193
Words hurt, Cade.

500
00:33:16,195 --> 00:33:17,394
There are exactly seven...
Count them.

501
00:33:17,396 --> 00:33:19,329
Seven signs of
the apocalypse.

502
00:33:19,331 --> 00:33:22,199
And that talisman
showing up here is
<i> numero uno.</i>

503
00:33:22,201 --> 00:33:23,734
If that fancy
pancake was real,

504
00:33:23,736 --> 00:33:26,737
I'd grab the spaceship
and blow
this dirtball planet.

505
00:33:26,739 --> 00:33:29,272
All right, I'm gonna go
slather myself in oil.

506
00:33:29,274 --> 00:33:31,508
Turn your back, drift,
if it offends
your sensibilities.

507
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:33,777
Now that is
something
you can't unsee.

508
00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:35,479
I barely understand
what's coming
out of your mouth.

509
00:33:35,481 --> 00:33:38,515
Hey! Hey, mister!

510
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:40,217
Oh, this isn't happening.

511
00:33:40,219 --> 00:33:43,086
You cannot stay here, kid.
I got enough strays.

512
00:33:43,088 --> 00:33:46,023
I'm not a kid!
I'm useful. I fix shit.

513
00:33:46,025 --> 00:33:48,091
Yeah, good for you.
Better than anyone.

514
00:33:48,093 --> 00:33:49,292
And I have a name,
you know.

515
00:33:49,294 --> 00:33:51,094
It's Izabella.
Izabella with a z.

516
00:33:51,096 --> 00:33:53,296
I don't care
if it's a z, an emoji,
or a dollar sign,

517
00:33:53,298 --> 00:33:54,498
all right?
This is no place for...

518
00:33:54,500 --> 00:33:56,433
Just go home. Please.

519
00:33:56,435 --> 00:33:58,168
I don't got a home.

520
00:33:59,370 --> 00:34:01,038
And they...

521
00:34:01,506 --> 00:34:03,273
They just killed

522
00:34:03,441 --> 00:34:06,176
the last thing that
i called family.

523
00:34:07,378 --> 00:34:09,046
So no,

524
00:34:10,782 --> 00:34:12,416
I'm not going anywhere.

525
00:34:14,118 --> 00:34:17,454
I want to stay and
i want to fight them.

526
00:34:18,122 --> 00:34:19,289
Them?

527
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:21,324
Let me tell you about them.

528
00:34:22,093 --> 00:34:24,361
All right?
Them have infinite funding.

529
00:34:25,063 --> 00:34:27,097
You can't fight them,
and you can't beat them.

530
00:34:27,465 --> 00:34:30,167
All right?
They have the support
of the entire world.

531
00:34:30,169 --> 00:34:31,568
You, you're a kid.

532
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:38,108
Why are you still
following me?

533
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:42,479
T!

534
00:34:44,616 --> 00:34:47,150
First flames, dude! Whoa!

535
00:34:47,152 --> 00:34:49,219
Hey! Mister!
Your trailer's on fire.

536
00:34:49,854 --> 00:34:51,321
Whoa. Hey, corner.

537
00:34:51,522 --> 00:34:53,857
Oh, my god.
Buddy! Oh,
I'm proud of you.

538
00:34:53,859 --> 00:34:55,592
I know, but you gotta do it
outside now, okay?

539
00:34:55,594 --> 00:34:57,594
You could burn
this whole place down.

540
00:34:57,596 --> 00:34:59,596
I know, but you're coming
into your power now,
all right?

541
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:01,465
So you gotta blow
the flames... ah! No.

542
00:35:05,536 --> 00:35:07,270
Terry, get me
a beer, will ya?

543
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:09,206
Hey, guys,
you gotta cut the crap.

544
00:35:09,208 --> 00:35:10,574
You're tearing
everything apart.

545
00:35:14,645 --> 00:35:17,280
Perfect delivery, buddy.
You gotta work on the pickup.

546
00:35:17,381 --> 00:35:19,583
I still got him
in training.

547
00:35:21,185 --> 00:35:22,552
What happened
to your family?

548
00:35:28,426 --> 00:35:30,594
Oh, wife passed away.
Daughter's at college.

549
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:32,529
She might as well
be on the moon.

550
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:34,431
At least
she's still here, bro.

551
00:35:34,433 --> 00:35:35,632
I go and visit her,
we both get arrested.

552
00:35:35,634 --> 00:35:37,501
Is that bad enough
for you, "bro"?

553
00:35:38,169 --> 00:35:39,669
Your turn, unless
you're too tough to share.

554
00:35:41,305 --> 00:35:43,273
Decepticon fired a rocket.

555
00:35:44,175 --> 00:35:46,176
Parents were home,
i wasn't.

556
00:35:46,544 --> 00:35:48,478
No way
i was going to foster.

557
00:35:51,449 --> 00:35:53,283
Hey, little guy.

558
00:35:53,885 --> 00:35:55,352
You're heavy!

559
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:57,888
You gotta go.
You can't stay here.

560
00:35:57,890 --> 00:35:59,256
I'm sorry.

561
00:36:04,228 --> 00:36:05,295
Fine.

562
00:36:06,364 --> 00:36:07,430
Fine.

563
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:13,236
Great. Look,
if you're hungry, I got
some frozen pizza burritos.

564
00:36:13,238 --> 00:36:15,238
There might be some
smucker's in the fridge.

565
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:17,207
And tell everyone
where you are.

566
00:36:17,209 --> 00:36:19,209
Hey, am I being blackmailed
by a 12-year-old?

567
00:36:19,944 --> 00:36:21,211
Fourteen.

568
00:36:21,512 --> 00:36:22,946
You know,
you're really missing out.

569
00:36:22,948 --> 00:36:24,714
'Cause it's okay to
be a kid, little j-lo.

570
00:36:25,650 --> 00:36:27,350
You think
you're a bad-ass, huh?

571
00:36:27,352 --> 00:36:29,252
All right, tough guy,
i got a pop quiz for you.

572
00:36:29,254 --> 00:36:31,588
Say you got
an inline energon leak
on a slant-6.

573
00:36:31,590 --> 00:36:33,924
Don't get it fixed,
autobot's about to
bleed out.

574
00:36:33,926 --> 00:36:35,926
You got 30 seconds.
Now, what are you
gonna do? Go.

575
00:36:35,928 --> 00:36:38,595
All right. First of all,
transformers
don't have a slant-6.

576
00:36:38,597 --> 00:36:41,665
That's a Chrysler engine,
like way back in
ancient history.

577
00:36:41,667 --> 00:36:43,266
The late '60s are
not ancient history.

578
00:36:43,268 --> 00:36:47,704
I'd cauterize the artery
and re-channel the central
flow into the... the...

579
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:49,573
The whatchamacallit,
the tube with the...

580
00:36:49,575 --> 00:36:51,708
The doohickey thing.
Yeah.

581
00:36:51,710 --> 00:36:53,210
Not bad.

582
00:36:53,411 --> 00:36:54,678
Watch your mouth.

583
00:37:09,527 --> 00:37:11,328
How long has this been here?

584
00:37:18,669 --> 00:37:20,503
It's growing. Yeah.

585
00:37:20,738 --> 00:37:22,305
Three meters a day.

586
00:37:33,651 --> 00:37:35,285
Six horns.

587
00:37:37,555 --> 00:37:39,289
Six horns, six locations.

588
00:37:40,324 --> 00:37:41,791
And they're growing at
an exponential rate.

589
00:37:41,793 --> 00:37:44,527
Alien...
Whatever they are.

590
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:47,430
Chinese call them
"horns from hell."

591
00:37:47,565 --> 00:37:49,299
Oh, my god.

592
00:37:49,700 --> 00:37:51,368
Cybertron is coming.

593
00:37:51,370 --> 00:37:52,535
What?

594
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:56,439
I'll have 17 minutes
to brief the president.

595
00:37:56,441 --> 00:37:59,476
It's an unmodeled
perturbation mass...

596
00:37:59,478 --> 00:38:02,345
Look at this.
It's amazing this
thing flies at all.

597
00:38:02,347 --> 00:38:04,547
Is it
some kind of
neck cancer?

598
00:38:05,483 --> 00:38:07,550
No. It's much worse
than that.

599
00:38:07,552 --> 00:38:11,588
It's a gravitational
anomaly caused by
a planet-sized object

600
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:13,757
with a current velocity
of 1/10th light speed.

601
00:38:13,759 --> 00:38:16,760
Hmm. That's some geek stuff.
Is it a threat?

602
00:38:17,361 --> 00:38:18,561
If you just give me...

603
00:38:18,563 --> 00:38:20,530
No, I got a lunch. No.

604
00:38:21,365 --> 00:38:23,466
No, it's not a threat.

605
00:38:24,402 --> 00:38:25,902
A threat might kill you.

606
00:38:26,404 --> 00:38:29,773
This will kill you
in three days.

607
00:38:34,812 --> 00:38:36,446
How much do you weigh?

608
00:38:36,647 --> 00:38:39,416
Are you technically
considered overweight?

609
00:38:39,418 --> 00:38:43,920
It's like somebody packed
10 pounds of shit
in a five-pound sack.

610
00:38:44,388 --> 00:38:45,655
No, he's
a chunky autobot.

611
00:38:45,657 --> 00:38:47,324
Ow! You wanna
stop that?

612
00:38:47,326 --> 00:38:49,392
Hound, pull up
the sat phone.

613
00:38:49,660 --> 00:38:53,697
I'm bouncing a signal
through Portugal,
Istanbul and Katmandu.

614
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:56,499
You got 20 seconds,
chief.

615
00:38:58,703 --> 00:39:00,503
Whoops.
Really?

616
00:39:00,505 --> 00:39:02,505
Infestation of
puppy transformers.

617
00:39:02,507 --> 00:39:04,641
This here's
a big boy zone.

618
00:39:05,744 --> 00:39:06,810
<i> Hello?</i>

619
00:39:07,411 --> 00:39:08,812
<i> Hello? Dad?</i>

620
00:39:09,547 --> 00:39:12,849
<i> Look, I know...</i>
<i> I know you can't talk to me</i>

621
00:39:13,451 --> 00:39:15,352
<i> or say anything back.</i>

622
00:39:15,354 --> 00:39:17,520
<i> But you can listen.</i>

623
00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:22,759
<i> I'm gonna say</i>
<i> what I always say</i>
<i> until you hear me.</i>

624
00:39:23,561 --> 00:39:25,895
<i> You don't need</i>
<i> to save the world.</i>

625
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:28,832
<i> You need</i>
<i> a frigging girlfriend.</i>

626
00:39:29,867 --> 00:39:32,936
<i>Wherever you are,</i>
<i>I don't want you to die alone.</i>

627
00:39:33,804 --> 00:39:36,940
<i> And I know you only</i>
<i> got five seconds left, so...</i>

628
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:40,410
<i> I'm fine, I'm safe.</i>

629
00:39:40,578 --> 00:39:42,746
<i> And I love...</i>

630
00:39:47,151 --> 00:39:50,453
Any longer, they'd have
snagged our location.

631
00:39:51,389 --> 00:39:53,823
You're a hell of a father,
Cade. Don't forget it.

632
00:39:53,825 --> 00:39:55,992
Hell, my dad never
called me.

633
00:40:04,568 --> 00:40:06,436
We call it the tank.

634
00:40:06,604 --> 00:40:08,438
He likes it down here.

635
00:40:08,706 --> 00:40:10,874
This is where I deal
with the dark shit.

636
00:40:11,609 --> 00:40:16,479
Decepticons seem
just as interested in
these structures as we are.

637
00:40:16,481 --> 00:40:18,782
Pred snapped this
in Siberia.

638
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:22,819
He's been seen at
all six horn locations
around the world.

639
00:40:22,821 --> 00:40:25,822
ID confirmed. Megatron.

640
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:29,926
<i>And get this.</i>
<i>He made contact with trf.</i>

641
00:40:29,928 --> 00:40:33,763
Snatched up two
CIA case officers.
Said he wants to negotiate.

642
00:40:33,765 --> 00:40:35,965
With him?
What the hell
does he want?

643
00:40:35,967 --> 00:40:39,536
<i> Certain alien</i>
<i>associates of his released.</i>

644
00:40:39,538 --> 00:40:42,705
<i> Scheduled contact is</i>
<i> ID'd and cleared.</i>

645
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:45,642
<i> Confirmation.</i>
<i> Hostages are clear.</i>

646
00:40:45,644 --> 00:40:47,510
<i> The department</i>
<i>of justice has okayed it</i>

647
00:40:47,512 --> 00:40:50,447
so long as the us military
watches his every move.

648
00:40:50,449 --> 00:40:53,817
You're gonna be on point,
because he is not our friend.

649
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:58,922
You know who they
always kill first?

650
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:04,027
Lawyers.

651
00:41:04,029 --> 00:41:07,997
We've made deals
with the devil before
during times of crisis.

652
00:41:08,532 --> 00:41:09,833
<i>If we're gonna</i>
<i>get through this,</i>

653
00:41:09,835 --> 00:41:11,568
<i>we have got to</i>
<i>open the door</i>

654
00:41:11,570 --> 00:41:13,536
<i>and let the monsters inside.</i>

655
00:41:13,838 --> 00:41:17,607
There is a weapon out there
of unimaginable power.

656
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:20,009
A threat to
our very existence.

657
00:41:20,011 --> 00:41:22,045
And Megatron
can lead us to it.

658
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:26,616
Do I know you, human?

659
00:41:26,784 --> 00:41:29,486
I want my crew!
Give me names!

660
00:41:29,787 --> 00:41:32,622
Mohawk.
Mohawk?

661
00:41:34,692 --> 00:41:37,060
What up, fellas? Man,
i want to kill you right now.

662
00:41:41,566 --> 00:41:44,534
Definitely gonna kill
y'all mofos later.

663
00:41:45,769 --> 00:41:47,971
He's cleared!
All right.

664
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:50,773
<i> Dreadbot.</i>

665
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:55,812
Dreadbot.
In for bank robbery.

666
00:41:57,716 --> 00:41:59,549
<i> Aggravated assault.</i>
<i> Murder.</i>

667
00:41:59,717 --> 00:42:01,584
Double murder.
Triple murder.
Nine dead.

668
00:42:01,586 --> 00:42:03,286
Didn't even take
the money. No.

669
00:42:03,288 --> 00:42:04,721
We're not
letting him out, no.

670
00:42:07,958 --> 00:42:09,092
What?

671
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:11,594
I mean,
but we can be flexible.

672
00:42:11,596 --> 00:42:12,962
If he wears
a GPS tracker,
it's fine.

673
00:42:12,964 --> 00:42:14,030
Okay, okay.

674
00:42:14,598 --> 00:42:15,865
Okay.

675
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,934
Nitro Zeus.

676
00:42:17,936 --> 00:42:19,602
Baby, free at last!

677
00:42:19,604 --> 00:42:21,804
Thank Megatron,
I'm free at last!

678
00:42:23,974 --> 00:42:26,309
Thank you.
Gonna miss you, Tim.

679
00:42:26,311 --> 00:42:28,778
Thank you for
your hospitality, Brad.

680
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:30,947
I know where
you live, Enrique.

681
00:42:30,949 --> 00:42:33,616
Say hello to your wife for me.

682
00:42:33,618 --> 00:42:36,819
But the government
requests that he does
not leave the county.

683
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:39,022
And we're serious
about that.
Okay.

684
00:42:39,757 --> 00:42:40,857
Okay.

685
00:42:40,859 --> 00:42:44,994
<i> And last</i>
<i>but not least, berserker.</i>

686
00:42:45,930 --> 00:42:47,730
I'll suck your brains!

687
00:42:49,767 --> 00:42:51,734
- Absolutely not.
- Yeah. No.

688
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:54,070
No. No.
There are limits.
Pick again.

689
00:42:54,072 --> 00:42:55,672
<i> Onslaught.</i>

690
00:42:55,674 --> 00:42:57,740
You need a bigger door!

691
00:42:59,777 --> 00:43:00,944
Uh...

692
00:43:00,946 --> 00:43:03,313
Let me run that up
the flag pole real quick.

693
00:43:03,315 --> 00:43:04,814
I just got to
call someone.

694
00:43:05,649 --> 00:43:07,150
Great, thank you. Yes. Yes!

695
00:43:07,651 --> 00:43:09,619
Go. Go.

696
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:11,654
What do you really want,
Megatron?

697
00:43:11,656 --> 00:43:14,023
What anyone wants,
human.

698
00:43:14,358 --> 00:43:15,959
To go home.

699
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:17,927
Yeah, that'd be all
right with me, too.

700
00:43:17,929 --> 00:43:20,697
<i> Megatron, he's</i>
<i> after something yeager has.</i>

701
00:43:20,699 --> 00:43:23,633
Something they need
to help find this weapon.

702
00:43:23,767 --> 00:43:26,336
We're gonna let
those Decepticons
do our dirty work.

703
00:43:26,338 --> 00:43:29,639
On my go, they'll be given
Yeager's hideout coordinates.

704
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:32,075
You track Megatron
every step.

705
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:33,977
Take the weapon.

706
00:43:34,712 --> 00:43:36,646
And then I'm taking
his ass out.

707
00:43:36,814 --> 00:43:40,984
No fear.
No hate. No anger.

708
00:43:50,828 --> 00:43:52,195
Hey, guys.

709
00:43:52,830 --> 00:43:55,898
Rise and shine.
Top of the morning!

710
00:43:59,169 --> 00:44:01,137
Broke our asses bagging
these Decepticons.

711
00:44:01,139 --> 00:44:02,238
Now they let them out?

712
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,374
What's really
going on, Lennox?

713
00:44:04,376 --> 00:44:05,775
Classified.

714
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:07,710
Just run your team.

715
00:44:15,052 --> 00:44:16,886
Today,

716
00:44:17,154 --> 00:44:19,656
we hunt.

717
00:44:19,658 --> 00:44:22,725
Another glorious,
boring day.

718
00:44:27,732 --> 00:44:31,968
<i> We're gonna have</i>
<i> all eoir sensors on</i>
<i> these guys as they move.</i>

719
00:44:31,970 --> 00:44:34,037
<i> Flight, push tactical</i>
<i> when airborne.</i>

720
00:44:34,738 --> 00:44:36,739
<i> I want air ops</i>
<i> locking down this transport.</i>

721
00:44:36,741 --> 00:44:38,875
Decepticons in sight 100%.

722
00:44:38,877 --> 00:44:41,244
Decepticons
have just been given
Yeager's location.

723
00:44:45,883 --> 00:44:48,818
<i> Cyclops. Decepticons</i>
<i> approaching junkyard target.</i>

724
00:44:50,854 --> 00:44:53,222
You strapping
on a decepticon arm?

725
00:44:55,092 --> 00:44:56,693
<i> Perfecto.</i>

726
00:44:56,994 --> 00:44:59,462
Well, he was an ugly
little robot.

727
00:44:59,464 --> 00:45:01,731
You look like a warrior,
sqweeks.

728
00:45:01,733 --> 00:45:03,032
<i> Muy guapo. </i>

729
00:45:03,767 --> 00:45:05,101
Here goes, bee.

730
00:45:05,103 --> 00:45:07,036
<i>Just do whatever you want.</i>

731
00:45:07,237 --> 00:45:09,906
Hey, z, come on over here
and work on a real bot.

732
00:45:09,908 --> 00:45:11,307
<i> Doc, come in, doc.</i>

733
00:45:16,146 --> 00:45:17,213
Oh, that's it.

734
00:45:18,115 --> 00:45:19,315
No, third one
on your left.

735
00:45:20,117 --> 00:45:21,918
No. Wait.
Your left. Right here.

736
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,287
I know what I'm doing.
Don't rush me.

737
00:45:24,788 --> 00:45:26,489
Hey, calm the temper, okay?

738
00:45:26,491 --> 00:45:27,890
Think he likes this?

739
00:45:28,158 --> 00:45:29,492
It's like being in
a dentist's chair.

740
00:45:29,494 --> 00:45:32,128
Do you like the dentist? No.

741
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:35,732
Hound said you can
only listen to her.

742
00:45:36,033 --> 00:45:38,968
Your daughter.
You can't talk back.

743
00:45:39,103 --> 00:45:40,970
He's got a big mouth.

744
00:45:41,805 --> 00:45:43,806
Said if you do,
they can voice match you

745
00:45:43,808 --> 00:45:46,175
from some computer somewhere
and track you down.

746
00:45:46,177 --> 00:45:48,211
Well, that's the world
we live in.

747
00:45:51,515 --> 00:45:52,782
What would you say to her?

748
00:45:54,818 --> 00:45:56,319
Brush your teeth,
work hard.

749
00:45:57,121 --> 00:45:59,922
Stay away from
any boy in a band,
especially a drummer.

750
00:45:59,924 --> 00:46:02,825
Yeah, drummers are the worst,
not to mention stupid!

751
00:46:02,827 --> 00:46:04,494
And DJs? Real dickheads.

752
00:46:04,496 --> 00:46:05,762
Come on.

753
00:46:08,065 --> 00:46:10,266
We had a thing. All right?
A saying, back and forth.

754
00:46:10,268 --> 00:46:12,835
She'd always ask me,
"dad, what are you
doing tomorrow?"

755
00:46:12,837 --> 00:46:15,004
And I'd say,
"I'll figure it out tomorrow."

756
00:46:16,074 --> 00:46:19,776
Looks to me like
you're running out
of tomorrows, yeager.

757
00:46:21,178 --> 00:46:23,146
That's just
what she'd say.

758
00:46:25,549 --> 00:46:26,816
Okay, bee.

759
00:46:26,984 --> 00:46:28,050
Done.

760
00:46:29,987 --> 00:46:32,088
Come on, buddy,
sit up. Let's hear it.

761
00:46:32,090 --> 00:46:33,256
Come on.

762
00:46:33,258 --> 00:46:37,093
Your real voice.
For the first time, buddy.
Belt it out.

763
00:46:37,095 --> 00:46:38,861
<i> This is so exciting.</i>

764
00:46:38,863 --> 00:46:41,230
<i> Oh, no. This isn't</i>
<i> my damn voice.</i>

765
00:46:41,532 --> 00:46:43,065
I'm gonna kill him, bee.

766
00:46:43,067 --> 00:46:44,167
<i> This is such bullshit.</i>

767
00:46:44,169 --> 00:46:47,236
All right? You're gonna speak
with your own voice one day.

768
00:46:47,238 --> 00:46:49,405
<i>Daytrader is</i>

Uh, that code.

770
00:47:00,217 --> 00:47:01,317
<i>There's somebody coming.</i>

771
00:47:01,319 --> 00:47:02,852

We gotta roll out now!

778
00:47:30,048 --> 00:47:33,883
I know the government
when I see the government.

779
00:47:33,885 --> 00:47:35,952
Grab as many weapons
as you can.

780
00:47:36,086 --> 00:47:38,154
I'm not going to jail.
I can't go to jail, man.

781
00:47:38,156 --> 00:47:40,122
Hey! This is the real world.
Okay? Let's go!

782
00:47:40,124 --> 00:47:41,591
I can't go to jail.
I'm too skinny for jail.

783
00:47:41,593 --> 00:47:42,859
I can't even lift weights.

784
00:47:47,332 --> 00:47:48,931
Bee, let's move!

785
00:47:48,933 --> 00:47:50,333
Give me this one.
You definitely gimme this one.

786
00:47:50,335 --> 00:47:52,068
This will mess somebody
up good.

787
00:47:52,070 --> 00:47:54,136
Roll out of here, Cade.
I'm gonna buy you some time.

788
00:47:54,138 --> 00:47:55,972
Don't be a hero, hound.
We're out of here now!

789
00:47:55,974 --> 00:47:57,039
Wait! Wait!

790
00:47:57,041 --> 00:47:58,140
Hell,
i was born a hero.

791
00:47:58,142 --> 00:47:59,208
You're not leaving me!

792
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:01,010
You leave me,
they take sqweeks.

793
00:48:01,012 --> 00:48:03,012
Leave sqweeks!
He's a survivor.

794
00:48:15,425 --> 00:48:17,159
Megatron,
they got up out of here.

795
00:48:17,161 --> 00:48:20,129
Unfortunate
'cause I was looking
to knock some heads.

796
00:48:21,031 --> 00:48:24,333
The end is near,
my old treacherous friend.

797
00:48:25,435 --> 00:48:29,438
What a shame
you'll be unable to see it.

798
00:48:33,277 --> 00:48:35,978
Come and get some,
you little bitch!

799
00:48:50,228 --> 00:48:53,296
We box these things in,
they will protect themselves.

800
00:48:53,463 --> 00:48:55,097
Yeah, we'll see.

801
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:00,436
Tactical positions, let's go!

802
00:49:07,110 --> 00:49:09,211
You, too, knuckle-dragger.
Stay out of sight. Come on.

803
00:49:10,280 --> 00:49:12,114
Decepticons are coming.

804
00:49:12,282 --> 00:49:15,351
All right. We all know
our hiding places.

805
00:49:15,485 --> 00:49:18,087
What's this? The tracker
brought them right to us.

806
00:49:18,089 --> 00:49:20,189
When are you going
to grow up?
<i>Dang it.</i>

807
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:22,692
<i> Target</i>
<i> is four klicks away.</i>

808
00:49:22,694 --> 00:49:25,027
<i> They just entered</i>
<i> an abandoned town.</i>

809
00:49:45,349 --> 00:49:47,116
Let's go. Out!
Out! Out! Out!

810
00:49:59,096 --> 00:50:00,229
Hey!

811
00:50:00,464 --> 00:50:02,732
Yeager's got vital intel.
Detain only.

812
00:50:02,734 --> 00:50:05,301
Trf operation.
Stay out of my way.

813
00:50:05,469 --> 00:50:07,603
Those were my men.

814
00:50:08,205 --> 00:50:10,373
Hey, there is some
scary shit going on out there.

815
00:50:10,375 --> 00:50:12,174
I'd like to at least
keep my blaster.

816
00:50:12,342 --> 00:50:14,210
Not today.
We're sticking to the plan.

817
00:50:14,212 --> 00:50:15,544
The whole town is
wired and rigged.

818
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:18,514
You! Sit down.
Now. Stay put.

819
00:50:35,332 --> 00:50:38,134
Just a heads up.
We're probably
going to jail,

820
00:50:38,136 --> 00:50:40,369
so try getting
used to that.

821
00:50:43,306 --> 00:50:44,573
Here they come.

822
00:50:48,779 --> 00:50:50,279
Autobots, get ready.

823
00:50:50,380 --> 00:50:52,415
Hey, Cade,
you mind if I bail?

824
00:50:52,417 --> 00:50:54,183
<i> Don't attack</i>
<i>until I say.</i>

825
00:50:55,185 --> 00:50:57,620
Aw, yeah, Decepticons
is in the streets.

826
00:50:58,088 --> 00:51:00,356
Oh, I feel a fight coming.
I'ma kill y'all right now.

827
00:51:00,457 --> 00:51:02,158
Search this town.

828
00:51:02,392 --> 00:51:04,460
He's here.

829
00:51:04,594 --> 00:51:07,329
I'm letting y'all know
what we came to do.

830
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:12,268
Get over here!

831
00:51:13,303 --> 00:51:16,272
Look at that little
blue beetle-looking mofo.

832
00:51:18,175 --> 00:51:19,608
Look at
this little ugly dude.

833
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:24,346
You are awash in
their repulsive scent.
Disgusting.

834
00:51:25,248 --> 00:51:27,149
- Hey!
<i>- Bee, stop her.</i>

835
00:51:27,284 --> 00:51:29,285
Put him down!

836
00:51:29,287 --> 00:51:33,122
Here she go. Look at her,
walking all strong with
pigtails.

837
00:51:33,124 --> 00:51:34,290
Go to hell!

838
00:51:34,391 --> 00:51:36,392
This planet is hell.

839
00:51:36,860 --> 00:51:38,661
Ooh,
what's that on your arm?

840
00:51:39,162 --> 00:51:41,397
- Put him down!
- Shit!

841
00:51:41,399 --> 00:51:43,165
You think I'm afraid
of you, <i> cabron?</i>

842
00:51:43,167 --> 00:51:45,301
Hey, stop!
Cade yeager.

843
00:51:45,303 --> 00:51:47,236
I need that talisman!

844
00:51:55,545 --> 00:51:57,313
We don't do
this kamikaze shit.

845
00:51:57,414 --> 00:51:59,448
You wanna go out there
and start screaming at
a decepticon?

846
00:51:59,450 --> 00:52:00,850
Get those vile beings.

847
00:52:00,852 --> 00:52:02,284
I'm on 'em!

848
00:52:27,277 --> 00:52:28,677
I got the leg!

849
00:52:29,212 --> 00:52:30,412
Gotcha!

850
00:52:31,615 --> 00:52:33,382
And his fat head.

851
00:52:33,384 --> 00:52:35,284
Don't get any better
than that.

852
00:52:35,286 --> 00:52:36,519
Drift, now!

853
00:52:36,920 --> 00:52:39,488
Decepticons, retreat!

854
00:52:39,490 --> 00:52:40,556
Chickens!

855
00:52:42,626 --> 00:52:44,593
That plan went to shit.

856
00:52:48,365 --> 00:52:49,698
That's the only plan
you got?

857
00:52:50,367 --> 00:52:51,700
Get down, get down,
get down!

858
00:52:55,238 --> 00:52:56,372
What are those?

859
00:52:56,374 --> 00:53:00,342
Whoa.
We gotta get inside.
Come on. Run.

860
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:02,378
This is supposed
to hunt terrorists,

861
00:53:02,380 --> 00:53:03,679
not tax-paying Americans!

862
00:53:03,681 --> 00:53:05,314
Not that I pay taxes, but...

863
00:53:05,649 --> 00:53:08,384
Yo, Meg! M-tron!

864
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:11,287
Stop playing. Come on.
Am I the only one in here?

865
00:53:13,957 --> 00:53:15,224
Ow!

866
00:53:15,926 --> 00:53:17,593
Oh, this ain't right.

867
00:53:24,534 --> 00:53:25,701
We're safe in here.

868
00:53:25,703 --> 00:53:27,269
There's
always one in charge.

869
00:53:27,271 --> 00:53:29,271
Just like back in Chicago,
like a mother.

870
00:53:46,756 --> 00:53:47,990
Go, go, go!

871
00:53:49,527 --> 00:53:50,626
Run!

872
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:52,261
Move, move, move!

873
00:53:59,536 --> 00:54:00,636
Hide
in that room!

874
00:54:01,004 --> 00:54:02,504
Come on,
come on, come on!

875
00:54:06,543 --> 00:54:07,743
I left the 'hood
to not get shot

876
00:54:07,745 --> 00:54:09,345
and now I'm getting shot.

877
00:54:09,446 --> 00:54:11,347
This is the worst job ever.

878
00:54:11,349 --> 00:54:12,681
Does this job even
have healthcare?

879
00:54:12,683 --> 00:54:14,316
It doesn't, do it?

880
00:54:14,318 --> 00:54:16,252
You try treating
a bullet wound
by yourself.

881
00:54:16,586 --> 00:54:17,753
Watch out!

882
00:54:21,024 --> 00:54:22,391
Run! Run!

883
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:32,735
Hide! Hide!

884
00:54:45,048 --> 00:54:46,782
<i> Facial mapping engaged.</i>

885
00:54:46,784 --> 00:54:48,417
You're a dead man.

886
00:55:03,366 --> 00:55:04,667
Oh, shit.
There's another one.

887
00:55:06,736 --> 00:55:09,471
I got this.
What are you doing?

888
00:55:09,572 --> 00:55:10,873
It's using
facial recognition.

889
00:55:12,375 --> 00:55:13,575
Are you crazy?

890
00:55:14,511 --> 00:55:15,711
Stay behind me.
What?

891
00:55:15,713 --> 00:55:17,446
Jimmy j, don't!
I got this.
Get behind me.

892
00:55:17,448 --> 00:55:18,714
Don't do it.
Get behind me.

893
00:55:18,716 --> 00:55:19,748
It's a bad idea!

894
00:55:19,750 --> 00:55:20,816
Oh!

895
00:55:21,084 --> 00:55:22,551
Shit.

896
00:55:24,788 --> 00:55:26,322
- Oh, my gosh.
- Are you okay?

897
00:55:29,527 --> 00:55:34,396
Cade,
i just want to tell you,
i love you, man.

898
00:55:34,732 --> 00:55:38,067
This job wasn't
what I thought, but
i appreciate everything.

899
00:55:38,069 --> 00:55:39,868
What are you doing?
I'm dying!

900
00:55:40,737 --> 00:55:41,870
It was only a beanbag, dude.

901
00:55:43,674 --> 00:55:46,442
There's no hole,
there's no blood,
no nothing.

902
00:55:46,444 --> 00:55:47,810
There's no hole.
Will you get up?

903
00:55:47,812 --> 00:55:51,714
It was a beanbag?
That shit hurt like
a bullet, man!

904
00:55:51,716 --> 00:55:52,915
I felt it go through me!

905
00:55:53,416 --> 00:55:55,351
Come on, that
building right there!

906
00:56:01,125 --> 00:56:04,860
All right,
we take out the big one,
we're gonna take them all out.

907
00:56:08,665 --> 00:56:10,833
Come on, come on, come on.
Hurry, hurry, they're coming.

908
00:56:14,437 --> 00:56:16,772
Oh, my god!
A leprechaun.
Who the hell are you?

909
00:56:17,574 --> 00:56:19,641
Leprechauns are
tiny, green and Irish,

910
00:56:19,643 --> 00:56:20,943
and that is offensive.

911
00:56:21,444 --> 00:56:22,911
What are you looking at,
little girl?

912
00:56:23,146 --> 00:56:24,847
<i> What are you looking at?</i>

913
00:56:25,148 --> 00:56:27,950
Hello. Master Cade,
i have been sent
to collect you.

914
00:56:28,418 --> 00:56:29,785
Collect me?
That is correct.

915
00:56:29,787 --> 00:56:30,886
Oh, you're not
collecting shit.

916
00:56:35,425 --> 00:56:36,692
Whoa, man! Slow down!

917
00:56:36,694 --> 00:56:37,760
So, you want to play rough.

918
00:56:43,166 --> 00:56:44,800
Oh! Oh!
No! No! Cade!

919
00:56:44,901 --> 00:56:46,402
Oh, shit!

920
00:56:46,636 --> 00:56:48,170
Cade! Cade!
Hold on!

921
00:56:53,476 --> 00:56:54,843
Did you see that?
Hang on!

922
00:56:54,845 --> 00:56:56,578
Oh, I am so clumsy!

923
00:56:56,780 --> 00:56:58,680
- Is he still alive?
- Hold on!

924
00:56:58,682 --> 00:57:00,149
Is he still living?

925
00:57:00,151 --> 00:57:01,917
No, he's going to die!

926
00:57:06,556 --> 00:57:07,856
My lord,
this is not my fault,

927
00:57:07,858 --> 00:57:09,725
but he just burst
out of the elevator.

928
00:57:09,727 --> 00:57:10,893
<i> Ten stories.</i>

929
00:57:10,895 --> 00:57:15,864
Did he live?
<i> I don't know!</i>
<i> He just flew!</i>

930
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:30,179
My lord,
rip an arm off a human

931
00:57:30,181 --> 00:57:31,647
and they'll go
wherever you want.

932
00:57:31,649 --> 00:57:32,648
<i> What's</i>
<i>the matter with you?</i>

933
00:57:54,571 --> 00:57:57,005
Whoa!

934
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:10,752
Eh, you little gnats.

935
00:58:11,621 --> 00:58:14,022
Oh, there you are.
Good to find you alive!

936
00:58:14,024 --> 00:58:15,824
Just like nothing happened.

937
00:58:15,826 --> 00:58:18,227
Let's make you
presentable.
Hey! Come on!

938
00:58:18,229 --> 00:58:19,895
Shiny, spic and span.

939
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:21,730
Back off, jeeves!
There.

940
00:58:21,732 --> 00:58:23,732
You look better
already, sir.
Who are you?

941
00:58:23,734 --> 00:58:26,702
My name is cogman, sir.
And I am here because of that.

942
00:58:26,836 --> 00:58:29,605
And that is here
because of you.

943
00:58:29,739 --> 00:58:33,509
It will not leave you
until your quest is fulfilled.

944
00:58:34,844 --> 00:58:36,778
You have been chosen.

945
00:58:38,516 --> 00:58:41,917
I will explain everything
if you'll kindly come with me.

946
00:58:41,919 --> 00:58:44,086
Eh, Cade, what's with
this c-3po rip-off?

947
00:58:44,554 --> 00:58:45,787
Don't kill the messenger

948
00:58:45,789 --> 00:58:47,823
or the messenger
will kill you.

949
00:58:49,726 --> 00:58:51,560
Ouch!

950
00:58:51,828 --> 00:58:54,863
Now then,
I'm afraid all this ballyhoo
is on your account.

951
00:58:54,865 --> 00:58:58,066
If you want to
save your friends,
you will leave them.

952
00:58:58,068 --> 00:58:59,735
Hey, don't talk
to that leprechaun!

953
00:58:59,737 --> 00:59:01,303
What, and run off with
some crazy ninja Butler?

954
00:59:01,305 --> 00:59:03,605
Your friends will be safe
in your absence.

955
00:59:03,773 --> 00:59:05,941
In your presence, unsafe.

956
00:59:06,276 --> 00:59:09,945
You are more important
than you can possibly imagine.

957
00:59:10,580 --> 00:59:12,648
You are needed, sir.

958
00:59:12,782 --> 00:59:13,849
Urgently.

959
00:59:14,584 --> 00:59:15,951
My master is
fond of saying

960
00:59:16,052 --> 00:59:18,020
that all the important
decisions in life

961
00:59:18,022 --> 00:59:22,624
often come down
to just one moment.

962
00:59:31,068 --> 00:59:33,835
You're gonna be all right.
You're family now.

963
00:59:33,937 --> 00:59:36,038
They're gonna
take care of you,
i promise.

964
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:38,807
The plane is waiting.
We are going to england.

965
00:59:38,809 --> 00:59:39,908
Bee?

966
00:59:39,910 --> 00:59:44,746
Listen up,
little miss sunshine,
I'm in charge now.

967
00:59:45,114 --> 00:59:48,116
Just don't expect
any bedtime stories.

968
00:59:55,892 --> 00:59:57,059
<i> Welcome to air folgan.</i>

969
00:59:57,061 --> 00:59:59,361
<i> Please strap in.</i>
<i> Turbulence can kill.</i>

970
00:59:59,363 --> 01:00:01,096
<i> There will be</i>
<i> no snack service</i>
<i> on this flight,</i>

971
01:00:01,098 --> 01:00:02,864
<i> no drinks, no fun.</i>

972
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:05,634
Tracking yeager.
He's over the pond right now.

973
01:00:05,802 --> 01:00:07,903
It took some finding,
but sats have him.

974
01:00:08,037 --> 01:00:09,905
Megatron and crew are
bearing down on the uk.

975
01:00:09,907 --> 01:00:12,641
So is yeager.
It's no coincidence.

976
01:00:13,076 --> 01:00:16,912
I want you airborne
with your team to
the uk asap.

977
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:22,618
Pick up. Pick up.

978
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:24,720
Yeah?

979
01:00:24,722 --> 01:00:28,690
<i>I've told you, you have</i>
<i>nothing to offer. Get lost.</i>

980
01:00:28,692 --> 01:00:31,126
I need a favor, folgers.
I'd do it myself, but I can't.

981
01:00:31,128 --> 01:00:32,394
You ever fly
a Cuban airplane?

982
01:00:32,396 --> 01:00:34,630
They're from the 1940s.
So are the pilots.

983
01:00:34,697 --> 01:00:36,031
<i> Book of cyber-kells.</i>

984
01:00:36,366 --> 01:00:37,666
I found it.

985
01:00:37,668 --> 01:00:38,834
<i>The ancient book?</i>
<i>Impossible.</i>

986
01:00:38,836 --> 01:00:43,739
The book exists.
Unseen for centuries.

987
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:46,375
Pages that literally dissolve
at room temperature,

988
01:00:46,377 --> 01:00:49,911
made from some old
kind of goat scrotum
or something.

989
01:00:49,913 --> 01:00:52,714
Trinity library.
Today, 4:00 P.M.

990
01:00:52,716 --> 01:00:54,850
Be there if you want to
know how it all ends.

991
01:01:00,923 --> 01:01:04,726
<i> Object confirmed</i>
<i> as exoplanet cybertron.</i>

992
01:01:05,928 --> 01:01:08,830
<i> Two days,</i>
<i> seven hours to impact.</i>

993
01:01:13,803 --> 01:01:16,938
<i> Optimus,</i>
<i>it is time</i>
<i>you knew the truth.</i>

994
01:01:17,407 --> 01:01:19,041
<i>The place you call earth</i>

995
01:01:19,809 --> 01:01:23,078
has another name.
Unicron.

996
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:26,982
Earth... unicron?

997
01:01:27,750 --> 01:01:30,919
Cybertron's
ancient enemy.

998
01:01:31,421 --> 01:01:32,788
Yes.

999
01:01:32,889 --> 01:01:34,890
You are going to kill him.

1000
01:01:35,425 --> 01:01:39,828
With my staff, we will drain
the very life from unicron.

1001
01:01:40,196 --> 01:01:43,198
- Earth will die...
- Yes.

1002
01:01:43,200 --> 01:01:45,967
And your world
will be reborn,

1003
01:01:46,202 --> 01:01:48,837
Nemesis prime.

1004
01:01:50,006 --> 01:01:54,910
I will fight anyone
who stands in my way.

1005
01:01:56,779 --> 01:01:58,180
<i> The alien</i>
<i> horns are still growing,</i>

1006
01:01:58,182 --> 01:02:00,982
<i> some of them</i>
<i> reaching 400 meters.</i>

1007
01:02:00,984 --> 01:02:03,785
More alien rubbish.

1008
01:02:03,920 --> 01:02:05,887
Have you found
a man yet, viviane?

1009
01:02:05,889 --> 01:02:07,723
No.
So sad.

1010
01:02:07,791 --> 01:02:12,094
I mean,
there are lots of adverts,
some of them very tempting.

1011
01:02:12,096 --> 01:02:14,863
This one's looking for a bbw.
I don't know what that is.

1012
01:02:14,865 --> 01:02:16,198
It's a car, dear.
Right.

1013
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:17,733
Big beautiful woman.

1014
01:02:17,834 --> 01:02:19,267
Is it? Who knew?

1015
01:02:19,269 --> 01:02:21,136
Looking at the classifieds!

1016
01:02:21,804 --> 01:02:23,472
Oh, this one's got
its own dungeon.

1017
01:02:23,474 --> 01:02:25,841
Great! I love dungeons!

1018
01:02:25,975 --> 01:02:27,809
See, that's perfect
for you, isn't it?

1019
01:02:27,811 --> 01:02:29,311
All that old stuff,
you'd love that.

1020
01:02:29,779 --> 01:02:32,013
History is being rewritten
and you want to talk about
a man.

1021
01:02:32,215 --> 01:02:33,515
Or a woman.

1022
01:02:33,517 --> 01:02:35,016
Aunt Helen.

1023
01:02:35,151 --> 01:02:36,752
"Women seeking women."
Here we go.

1024
01:02:37,987 --> 01:02:39,955
You could ask me
about my work.

1025
01:02:39,957 --> 01:02:41,223
Why would we do that?

1026
01:02:41,225 --> 01:02:43,792
I mean,
it's just dusty old books.

1027
01:02:43,893 --> 01:02:45,260
Now I welcome
the end of days!

1028
01:02:45,262 --> 01:02:46,962
What's so terrible
about me wanting you

1029
01:02:46,964 --> 01:02:48,897
to have what I had
with your father?

1030
01:02:48,899 --> 01:02:50,232
He was an ass.

1031
01:02:50,234 --> 01:02:54,002
The one thing that
his beloved knights
of the round table

1032
01:02:54,004 --> 01:02:56,138
had in spades
and he was utterly lacking?

1033
01:02:56,973 --> 01:02:58,039
Honor.

1034
01:02:58,141 --> 01:02:59,841
You can say that again.

1035
01:02:59,843 --> 01:03:02,544
If you can stop loathing
a dead man long enough,

1036
01:03:02,546 --> 01:03:04,079
you might want to have
a look in his study.

1037
01:03:04,081 --> 01:03:06,948
<i> There might be something</i>
<i> you want to keep.</i>

1038
01:03:31,874 --> 01:03:33,375
Do not touch that!

1039
01:03:34,277 --> 01:03:36,077
Sorry, daddy.

1040
01:03:38,314 --> 01:03:39,581
I don't want anything.

1041
01:03:39,583 --> 01:03:41,383
Tell the university
to take the lot.

Back! Be quiet!
Do not hit me again!

1053
01:04:41,143 --> 01:04:43,144
So, which bloody bot
are you, then?

1054
01:04:43,279 --> 01:04:45,247
Soundwave? Shockwave?

1055
01:04:45,249 --> 01:04:48,283
At least tell me
that I've been abducted

I am so much
better than all of them!

Wow!

01:05:12,108 --> 01:05:13,508
Wow, I love this car!

1065
01:05:28,257 --> 01:05:31,459
Ah,
the white cliffs of Dover.

1066

That's a good girl.
Good girl.

1067
01:05:50,212 --> 01:05:53,081
Good girl. Come on.
There's a good girl.

1068
01:06:11,701 --> 01:06:13,134
We have guests!

1069
01:06:13,136 --> 01:06:14,970
What's the matter with you?

1070
01:06:14,972 --> 01:06:16,972
Oh, shit!
My bits are falling off.

1071
01:06:16,974 --> 01:06:18,106
Idiot!

1072
01:06:18,441 --> 01:06:20,175
Hello there!

1073
01:06:21,110 --> 01:06:22,978
<i> What the hell?</i>

1074
01:06:23,714 --> 01:06:28,516
I'm awfully sorry about that,
but, um, you see,

1075
01:06:29,085 --> 01:06:33,321
he thinks it's still
the year 1918 or 1914.
Something like that.

1076
01:06:33,323 --> 01:06:34,456
So sad.

1077
01:06:34,458 --> 01:06:36,224
World war i
and all that stuff.

1078
01:06:36,759 --> 01:06:38,526
I mean...
Battle of the marne,
battle of the somme,

1079
01:06:38,528 --> 01:06:40,362
battle of the marne,
battle of passchendaele.

1080
01:06:40,529 --> 01:06:43,064
Trenches and mud
and death

1081
01:06:43,066 --> 01:06:45,000
and Gore and all that.
It's terribly sad.

1082
01:06:45,002 --> 01:06:47,435
"It's a long way to tipperary,
it's a long way to go."

1083
01:06:47,437 --> 01:06:50,071
Yeah, but it's, um...
It's terrible!

1084
01:06:50,073 --> 01:06:52,741
I mean, so sad, you know?
But then, I mean...

1085
01:06:52,743 --> 01:06:55,477
Isn't it? I mean, this late
onset of, um, well...

1086
01:06:56,379 --> 01:06:58,213
Robot dementia.

1087
01:06:58,215 --> 01:07:00,148
It's not at all pretty.

1088
01:07:00,416 --> 01:07:04,019
Ah, I don't know
what you're smoking
in that pipe, man, but...

1089
01:07:04,186 --> 01:07:05,787
What's going on here?

1090
01:07:05,789 --> 01:07:10,025
Look, somebody
better start talking,
or I'm outta here.

1091
01:07:10,027 --> 01:07:11,359
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay.

1092
01:07:11,361 --> 01:07:13,061
Um, Bumblebee?

1093
01:07:13,229 --> 01:07:15,130
We only met when
i was a little boy
in short pants.

1094
01:07:15,132 --> 01:07:19,134
Maybe taller.
Or maybe shorter,
i can't remember.

1095
01:07:19,268 --> 01:07:20,368
But never forget a face.

1096
01:07:20,370 --> 01:07:21,569
Bee, you know this guy?

1097
01:07:23,773 --> 01:07:25,473
Let's have a look
at this thing.

1098
01:07:25,475 --> 01:07:27,175
Please.
Very interesting.

1099
01:07:28,377 --> 01:07:29,511
Yes.

1100
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:34,049
You keep a secret for so long,
knowing it to be true,

1101
01:07:34,051 --> 01:07:35,617
and yet, deep down inside,

1102
01:07:36,252 --> 01:07:38,253
you begin to wonder,

1103
01:07:38,788 --> 01:07:41,122
"has my life been wasted?"

1104
01:07:41,590 --> 01:07:44,092
Have you ever felt
like that, Mr. Cade?

1105
01:07:45,829 --> 01:07:50,331
Look, old timer, I don't
have a ton of Patience
for riddles right now.

1106
01:07:50,833 --> 01:07:53,601
Yes, but you want to know,
don't you, "dude,"

1107
01:07:54,470 --> 01:07:56,204
why they keep coming here.

1108
01:07:56,539 --> 01:07:59,507
To earth. Right?

1109
01:08:02,111 --> 01:08:05,180
Ah! I do so love
perfect timing.

1110
01:08:08,417 --> 01:08:10,452
What a bitchin' car she is!

1111
01:08:19,229 --> 01:08:22,864
Why do you have to
be like that? <i> Pourquoi?</i>

1112
01:08:24,567 --> 01:08:26,501
So, is this
a kidnapping
sort of situation

1113
01:08:26,503 --> 01:08:28,837
or her first
transformer
experience?

1114
01:08:28,839 --> 01:08:30,171
It's both, really.

1115
01:08:30,173 --> 01:08:32,140
Do not hit me again!

1116
01:08:32,341 --> 01:08:36,144
But she does have
a rather nice
fight-or-flight response.

1117
01:08:36,445 --> 01:08:39,147
- She's very difficult.

1118
01:08:40,349 --> 01:08:43,251
<i>My name is Edmond Burton,</i>
<i>12th Earl of folgan.</i>

1119
01:08:43,253 --> 01:08:46,187
Last surviving member
of the order of
the witwiccans.

1120
01:08:46,189 --> 01:08:47,689
Wow.

1121
01:08:48,457 --> 01:08:49,557
What's up?

1122
01:08:56,532 --> 01:08:58,333
Does he have to loom
like that?

1123
01:09:02,638 --> 01:09:03,671
"Ut" what?

1124
01:09:05,342 --> 01:09:07,442
"Ut rut"?

1125
01:09:07,444 --> 01:09:09,377
- Hot rod.
- Mmm-hmm.

1126
01:09:09,379 --> 01:09:10,445
It's his French accent.

1127
01:09:10,447 --> 01:09:11,546
Is he French?

1128
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:13,448
No, he just likes
the accent.

1129
01:09:13,549 --> 01:09:17,318
No, no, no! I hate the accent!
But I can't get rid of it.

1130
01:09:17,320 --> 01:09:19,220
I'm stuck with
the accent. Ugh.

1131
01:09:19,222 --> 01:09:20,488
He's a soldier,
miss viviane.

1132
01:09:20,490 --> 01:09:23,491
He swore
an oath to your father
to protect you.

1133
01:09:23,493 --> 01:09:25,927
Huh.
Some dad
you got there.

1134
01:09:25,929 --> 01:09:27,562
That is a nice ride.
I mean,
you can roll right up

1135
01:09:27,564 --> 01:09:29,230
to Buckingham Palace
in that thing.

1136
01:09:29,232 --> 01:09:31,499
Okay, you,
American man, shut it.

1137
01:09:32,902 --> 01:09:34,302
What am I doing here?

1138
01:09:34,403 --> 01:09:36,571
- Yeah, why is she here?
- Introductions.

1139
01:09:37,506 --> 01:09:39,374
Miss viviane wembly.
Master of history, Oxford.

1140
01:09:39,376 --> 01:09:41,309
Doctor of philosophy,
also Oxford.

1141
01:09:41,311 --> 01:09:44,245
And doctor of letters,
again Oxford, I think.
Anything else?

1142
01:09:44,247 --> 01:09:45,647
Anyway, meet Cade.

1143
01:09:46,415 --> 01:09:47,549
Yeager.

1144
01:09:48,217 --> 01:09:50,218
Cade yeager.
I'm an inventor.

1145
01:09:50,220 --> 01:09:51,519
Oh, you're an inventor.

1146
01:09:51,521 --> 01:09:53,388
Yes, I am.
What have you invented?

1147
01:09:53,489 --> 01:09:55,456
A lot of things.
Like?

1148
01:09:56,325 --> 01:09:58,259
Like a lot of
things. Like...

1149
01:09:58,261 --> 01:10:00,261
Things that
you've heard of.
Like?

1150
01:10:00,263 --> 01:10:01,462
Well, things that you will
have heard of, okay?

1151
01:10:01,464 --> 01:10:02,630
Patents are pending.

1152
01:10:03,933 --> 01:10:05,233
Ah.

1153
01:10:05,568 --> 01:10:06,734
"Ah"?

1154
01:10:07,269 --> 01:10:08,937
Don't say that.
What's "ah"?

1155
01:10:08,939 --> 01:10:10,405
You know,
i could do that, too.
"Oh, I'm English,

1156
01:10:10,407 --> 01:10:11,673
"and I'm too cool
for feelings."

1157
01:10:11,675 --> 01:10:16,377
by some over-educated
ivory-tower Princess
in a stripper dress?

1158
01:10:16,612 --> 01:10:17,679
Stripper?

1159
01:10:17,681 --> 01:10:20,615
Well, only in America
is a finer education
an insult.

1160
01:10:20,617 --> 01:10:22,517
And if my dress makes
you feel uncomfortable,

1161
01:10:22,519 --> 01:10:24,285
then maybe
i could take it off.

1162
01:10:24,653 --> 01:10:25,720
Okay.

1163
01:10:25,722 --> 01:10:28,223
That's enough!

1164
01:10:28,624 --> 01:10:30,758
- What's your problem?
- No, no, no!

1165
01:10:31,527 --> 01:10:33,428
Cogman?

1166
01:10:33,430 --> 01:10:34,762
Shall I take
his head off, madam?

1167
01:10:35,264 --> 01:10:38,533
Tempting, but, um,
i can defend my own honor.

1168
01:10:38,701 --> 01:10:41,703
But I do so very much want
to crush his windpipe.

1169
01:10:42,771 --> 01:10:45,707
Control, cogman.
You must learn to
control that impulse.

1170
01:10:45,709 --> 01:10:47,575
Channel it into
other things.

1171
01:10:48,712 --> 01:10:50,345
Yes, my lord.

1172
01:10:50,479 --> 01:10:54,249
Like making beds
or cooking food.

1173
01:10:54,483 --> 01:10:58,786
Polishing the silver.
I am trying, my lord.

1174
01:10:59,255 --> 01:11:01,756
- He is a "headmaster."
- A very rare breed.

1175
01:11:02,258 --> 01:11:03,725
That dude
is disturbed, yeah?

1176
01:11:03,727 --> 01:11:06,361
Like, seriously evil.
Like, split personality.

1177
01:11:06,495 --> 01:11:07,562
Good.

1178
01:11:07,564 --> 01:11:12,300
Cogman?
Glass 17c is missing.
Did you break it?

1179
01:11:12,468 --> 01:11:14,769
I've been a Butler
for the aristocracy
for 700 years.

1180
01:11:14,771 --> 01:11:17,305
You are the worst
I've ever worked for!

1181
01:11:17,307 --> 01:11:18,740
Ah, these were
all my predecessors.

1182
01:11:19,008 --> 01:11:21,542
They're all folgans.
And that was my aunt there.

1183
01:11:21,644 --> 01:11:23,344
My great-great-
great-great aunt.

1184
01:11:23,346 --> 01:11:25,446
She poisoned
my great-great-great
uncle for some reason.

1185
01:11:25,448 --> 01:11:27,448
She was barking mad,
she was an absolute bitch.

1186
01:11:27,450 --> 01:11:29,484
There's my grandfather
over there, aloysius.

1187
01:11:29,486 --> 01:11:31,386
And that's Arnold,
my third cousin.

1188
01:11:31,388 --> 01:11:33,755
He drunk sewage water,
committed suicide.
He was quite mad.

1189
01:11:33,757 --> 01:11:35,556
They were all mad, really.

1190
01:11:35,658 --> 01:11:37,292
There's bullet holes.

1191
01:11:38,761 --> 01:11:41,362
Uh-uh.
No, no. Nasty critter.

1192
01:11:41,364 --> 01:11:42,864
No, no, no, no, no.

1193
01:11:43,465 --> 01:11:46,367
That's the watch
that killed Hitler.
Don't screw with it.

1194
01:11:47,636 --> 01:11:50,305
These are all
the witwiccans.

1195
01:11:50,307 --> 01:11:52,373
In our halcyon days
we were quite the club.

1196
01:11:52,508 --> 01:11:55,476
Brilliant minds,
explorers, scientists,
artists, world leaders.

1197
01:11:55,644 --> 01:11:57,045
Renaissance thrill seekers.

1198
01:11:57,047 --> 01:11:59,314
People like
Catherine the great,
empress of all Russia,

1199
01:11:59,316 --> 01:12:03,918
Harriet tubman,
the Wright brothers,

1200
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:08,489
Stephen Hawking, Henry v,
Leonardo Da Vinci,

1201
01:12:08,491 --> 01:12:10,758
Newton, de lavoisier, Mozart,
Beethoven, mahler,

1202
01:12:10,760 --> 01:12:13,394
Edmund Hillary,
Teddy Roosevelt, copernicus,

1203
01:12:13,396 --> 01:12:14,929
Tesla, Galileo.

1204
01:12:15,397 --> 01:12:17,432
They all belonged
to a secret society,
you see.

1205
01:12:17,434 --> 01:12:18,900
All united in one cause.

1206
01:12:19,368 --> 01:12:22,370
To protect
the secret history
of transformers.

1207
01:12:22,738 --> 01:12:25,340
Here. On earth.

1208
01:12:25,808 --> 01:12:28,476
Now, this is
the witwiccan family tree.

1209
01:12:28,811 --> 01:12:30,745
Merlin, Viviana.

1210
01:12:30,846 --> 01:12:32,914
Goes back 40 generations.

1211
01:12:33,415 --> 01:12:35,650
Go over to that desk.
There's a photograph there.

1212
01:12:35,818 --> 01:12:37,752
Your father was a member.

1213
01:12:38,554 --> 01:12:40,755
He very much wanted
to tell you that.

1214
01:12:42,758 --> 01:12:44,926
And my own family
had some...

1215
01:12:47,663 --> 01:12:49,731
Small part in all this.

1216
01:12:50,699 --> 01:12:52,367
Zb-7.

1217
01:12:52,434 --> 01:12:53,768
That looks just like bee.

1218
01:12:53,770 --> 01:12:56,404
It is. He was attached
to the devil's brigade.

1219
01:12:56,572 --> 01:12:58,639
Pretty vicious military unit.

1220
01:12:58,707 --> 01:13:00,641
<i> Helped turn</i>
<i> the tide of war, you know?</i>

1221
01:13:11,854 --> 01:13:13,454
We're not invited.

1222
01:13:41,850 --> 01:13:42,917
- Bee?
- Yeah.

1223
01:13:42,919 --> 01:13:44,018
But he's so nice.

1224
01:13:44,486 --> 01:13:45,620
Behind the lines,
during the war,

1225
01:13:45,622 --> 01:13:47,455
they called him many things.

1226
01:13:47,623 --> 01:13:49,590
"Nice" was never one of them.

1227
01:13:49,958 --> 01:13:52,193
It all began in 484 ad,

1228
01:13:52,195 --> 01:13:55,029
when king Arthur
and his wizard, Merlin,

1229
01:13:55,531 --> 01:13:58,599
stared down and vanquished
the Saxon hordes
at mount badon.

1230
01:13:58,700 --> 01:14:01,035
That's his sword
and his mace there.

1231
01:14:01,703 --> 01:14:03,171
It's a myth.

1232
01:14:03,173 --> 01:14:04,772
Yeah,
every legend, every myth,

1233
01:14:04,774 --> 01:14:07,208
every story whispered
around the campfire

1234
01:14:07,210 --> 01:14:08,943
has a logical explanation.

1235
01:14:08,945 --> 01:14:10,678
Oh, with that
i agree wholeheartedly,

1236
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:11,946
but logic has
left the building.

1237
01:14:11,948 --> 01:14:13,748
You're talking about magic.

1238
01:14:13,750 --> 01:14:16,217
What, like your walking,
talking lamborghini?

1239
01:14:16,219 --> 01:14:17,819
"Any sufficiently
advanced technology

1240
01:14:17,821 --> 01:14:19,654
"is indistinguishable
from magic."

1241
01:14:19,656 --> 01:14:21,656
Arthur c. Clarke.
Impressive.

1242
01:14:21,658 --> 01:14:23,758
Yeah. And count 'em,
zero student loans,

1243
01:14:23,760 --> 01:14:26,727
doctor,
or professor, philosopher,
whatever you call yourself.

1244
01:14:27,196 --> 01:14:28,896
It's all of the above.

1245
01:14:34,203 --> 01:14:35,803
Now, this place was built

1246
01:14:36,772 --> 01:14:39,040
around the original
round table.

1247
01:14:39,541 --> 01:14:42,777
Percival, gawain,
Tristan, Lancelot.

1248
01:14:46,682 --> 01:14:48,616
<i> They sat right here.</i>

1249
01:14:50,953 --> 01:14:52,620
<i> Twelve in all.</i>

1250
01:14:52,855 --> 01:14:57,492
<i> And behind them sat the 12</i>
<i> who came from cybertron.</i>

1251
01:15:02,865 --> 01:15:04,765
We fight for honor.

1252
01:15:05,734 --> 01:15:07,902
We fight for the human race.

1253
01:15:08,237 --> 01:15:10,505
For all
that is good in mankind.

1254
01:15:10,739 --> 01:15:13,841
To brothers old
and brothers new!

1255
01:15:13,976 --> 01:15:17,612
To brothers old
and brothers new!

1256
01:15:25,287 --> 01:15:28,656
No sacrifice, no victory!

1257
01:15:28,857 --> 01:15:32,527
Twelve alien knights
who saw in Camelot

1258
01:15:32,529 --> 01:15:34,996
what the human race
could be at its finest.

1259
01:15:35,297 --> 01:15:36,864
A race of honor.

1260
01:15:46,909 --> 01:15:48,042
Cogman?
Hmm?

1261
01:15:48,577 --> 01:15:50,545
You ruined
the moment again!

1262
01:15:50,547 --> 01:15:53,014
I was making
the moment more epic.

1263
01:15:53,016 --> 01:15:54,649
Just be quiet.

1264
01:15:54,651 --> 01:15:56,284
What's the matter
with you?

1265
01:15:56,286 --> 01:15:58,019
If I could find his neck,
I'd strangle him.

1266
01:15:58,820 --> 01:16:01,088
This belonged to
king Arthur himself.

1267
01:16:02,057 --> 01:16:05,660
Now, legend held that
one last knight would
someday be chosen

1268
01:16:06,028 --> 01:16:08,863
<i> and the struggle to save</i>
<i> the world would begin.</i>

1269
01:16:09,031 --> 01:16:11,098
It would appear,
Mr. Cade,

1270
01:16:11,967 --> 01:16:14,969
that that last knight
is you.

1271
01:16:17,340 --> 01:16:20,708
You're saying
he traveled the whole
universe to find me?

1272
01:16:20,710 --> 01:16:22,310
No, not you
specifically.

1273
01:16:22,312 --> 01:16:23,811
Not a failed inventor
from the state of Texas.

1274
01:16:23,813 --> 01:16:24,879
No, god forbid.

1275
01:16:26,715 --> 01:16:27,782
Stop it!

1276
01:16:28,050 --> 01:16:29,884
What?

1277
01:16:30,720 --> 01:16:34,655
I will send
you back to cybertron
in a little tiny box.

1278
01:16:34,657 --> 01:16:35,790
Oh, scary.

1279
01:16:35,792 --> 01:16:37,592
I am not
a failed inventor.

1280
01:16:37,594 --> 01:16:40,695
No, he meant the qualities
of a knight, Mr. Cade.

1281
01:16:41,330 --> 01:16:43,931
Miss viviane,
the qualities of a knight,
if you please?

1282
01:16:44,333 --> 01:16:45,800
Qualities of a knight,
purity of heart,

1283
01:16:45,802 --> 01:16:48,002
valor, honor,
virtue, integrity.

1284
01:16:48,004 --> 01:16:50,371
Oh, and
most importantly...

1285
01:16:50,373 --> 01:16:52,640
Is he chaste?
Chased?

1286
01:16:52,642 --> 01:16:54,342
Dude, I was getting chased
when your little weirdo buddy

1287
01:16:54,344 --> 01:16:55,643
brought me over here
on the plane.

1288
01:16:55,944 --> 01:16:57,111
"Chaste."

1289
01:16:57,379 --> 01:16:58,879
C-h-a-s-t-e.

1290
01:16:58,981 --> 01:17:00,047
"T."

1291
01:17:00,049 --> 01:17:02,783
Yeah, I know...
I was making a joke.

1292
01:17:02,785 --> 01:17:04,051
You don't think
i know how to spell?

1293
01:17:04,053 --> 01:17:05,953
I know what he meant.
Sure you were.

1294
01:17:05,955 --> 01:17:07,822
No whoopee, Mr. Cade?

1295
01:17:08,824 --> 01:17:10,391
It's been a while.

1296
01:17:10,393 --> 01:17:13,060
Well, how long's "a while"?
A week? A month? A year?

1297
01:17:13,662 --> 01:17:14,862
None of
your business.

1298
01:17:14,864 --> 01:17:16,631
Well, we need to
ask you the question.

1299
01:17:17,366 --> 01:17:18,399
A while!

1300
01:17:18,401 --> 01:17:19,867
Huh.
Hmm.

1301
01:17:20,402 --> 01:17:21,636
"Huh"? What is this?

1302
01:17:21,638 --> 01:17:22,737
Is that, like,
another English thing?

1303
01:17:22,739 --> 01:17:25,039
No, no.
Just a curious thing.

1304
01:17:25,041 --> 01:17:26,641
Well, maybe
I'm saving myself.

1305
01:17:26,643 --> 01:17:28,142
What are you saving
yourself for, old age?

1306
01:17:28,144 --> 01:17:29,910
You, English lady,
shut it.

1307
01:17:32,114 --> 01:17:34,248
What is this?
Some sort of a map?

1308
01:17:34,916 --> 01:17:36,684
Oh, this table
is from cybertron.

1309
01:17:36,686 --> 01:17:39,820
It's a puzzle
I've been working on
for some time.

1310
01:17:39,822 --> 01:17:40,955
My entire life, actually.

1311
01:17:40,957 --> 01:17:43,858
And what do
these glyphs say about it?

1312
01:17:43,860 --> 01:17:45,159
They're
olde cybertronian.

1313
01:17:45,927 --> 01:17:48,896
A mantra whispered
through the cosmos.

1314
01:17:49,731 --> 01:17:51,766
<i> "Seglass ni tonday."</i>

1315
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,267
Wait a minute.

1316
01:17:53,769 --> 01:17:55,069
I heard that before.

1317
01:17:56,405 --> 01:17:59,140
A knight on a ship.
What does it mean?

1318
01:17:59,142 --> 01:18:02,209
"With your dying breath,
protect the staff."

1319
01:18:03,178 --> 01:18:05,246
Okay, this
is ridiculous.

1320
01:18:11,019 --> 01:18:12,887
They had their name for it.

1321
01:18:12,889 --> 01:18:14,121
We have ours.

1322
01:18:14,890 --> 01:18:16,190
<i> The staff of Merlin.</i>

1323
01:18:16,192 --> 01:18:20,861
<i> Bequeathed to him</i>
<i>by an alien race.</i>
<i>Fused with his DNA.</i>

1324
01:18:20,996 --> 01:18:24,832
So that only
he would have the key
to unlock its alien power.

1325
01:18:25,834 --> 01:18:28,102
Or as they knew it
in those days,

1326
01:18:28,770 --> 01:18:30,037
magic.

1327
01:18:32,040 --> 01:18:35,710
<i> The staff was buried</i>
<i> with Merlin's body.</i>

1328
01:18:35,911 --> 01:18:38,079
A thousand years
we've kept it hidden.

1329
01:18:38,780 --> 01:18:41,115
If it ever fell
into the wrong hands,
it would mean

1330
01:18:41,249 --> 01:18:45,720
the imminent destruction
of everything
we know and love.

1331
01:18:45,921 --> 01:18:50,057
The 12 guardian knights
combined into a mighty
dragon to protect it.

1332
01:18:50,059 --> 01:18:52,193
And now it is
in great danger.

1333
01:18:52,461 --> 01:18:55,029
Megatron.
He was after this.

1334
01:18:55,031 --> 01:18:56,764
So the battle is upon us.

1335
01:18:56,766 --> 01:18:58,499
It is why they're here,
why they keep coming to earth.

1336
01:18:58,501 --> 01:19:01,202
And we must claim the staff
before it is too late.

1337
01:19:01,204 --> 01:19:02,870
Wait. We what?

1338
01:19:02,938 --> 01:19:05,906
Only a direct descendant
of Merlin himself

1339
01:19:06,208 --> 01:19:09,276
can wield this instrument
of absolute power.

1340
01:19:09,945 --> 01:19:12,480
And you, miss viviane,

1341
01:19:12,482 --> 01:19:15,816
are Merlin's last descendant
here on earth, and as such,

1342
01:19:15,818 --> 01:19:17,318
you are our last hope.

1343
01:19:17,953 --> 01:19:19,286
Okay, wait. Go back.

1344
01:19:19,288 --> 01:19:22,022
You're saying
that I'm related to
the wizard Merlin?

1345
01:19:25,494 --> 01:19:27,161
Oh. Oh.

1346
01:19:28,130 --> 01:19:29,330
Bit of a shock, isn't it?

1347
01:19:30,499 --> 01:19:32,266
Only you know
the staff's location,

1348
01:19:32,268 --> 01:19:34,235
imparted to you
by your father.

1349
01:19:34,870 --> 01:19:37,171
He had to leave a clue,
didn't he?

1350
01:19:37,807 --> 01:19:41,075
She doesn't have that
"i know where
the staff is" look.

1351
01:19:41,077 --> 01:19:43,978
Listen, the only thing
that my father imparted to me

1352
01:19:43,980 --> 01:19:45,513
was to get out
of his study.

1353
01:19:45,515 --> 01:19:47,948
"Two worlds colliding,
only one survives."

1354
01:19:48,116 --> 01:19:51,185
Your words exactly.
Only lecture time is over.

1355
01:19:51,319 --> 01:19:53,854
You were born for this.

1356
01:19:54,222 --> 01:19:56,857
This is the latest image
of their world coming here.

1357
01:19:56,992 --> 01:19:59,059
And you're all that stand
in its way.

1358
01:19:59,227 --> 01:20:01,095
So you'd better find
that staff quickly.

1359
01:20:02,965 --> 01:20:05,833
<i> Surround the castle</i>
<i> and lock it down.</i>

1360
01:20:08,971 --> 01:20:11,238
MI6 and trf are here!

1361
01:20:11,339 --> 01:20:13,073
Move it! Go!

1362
01:20:13,208 --> 01:20:15,409
Cogman, get me
to London, okay?

1363
01:20:18,980 --> 01:20:20,848
- The decoy car is ready?
- Hurry along.

1364
01:20:23,285 --> 01:20:25,352
Whoa!
I got 'em boys!

1365
01:20:29,225 --> 01:20:31,826
Hurry, move!
Quick, quick, quick!

1366
01:20:32,561 --> 01:20:34,028
Get us
out of here, bee.

1367
01:20:34,030 --> 01:20:38,232
Get out of here!
My weapon
will stop the time!

1368
01:20:51,112 --> 01:20:54,882
Oh! Einstein
would've been
tickled pink. Foo-foo!

1369
01:20:57,252 --> 01:20:59,854
Quick, this way,
this way! Hurry!

1370
01:20:59,988 --> 01:21:02,156
Shotgun.
I call shotgun.

1371
01:21:10,599 --> 01:21:12,900
<i> Inbound helos,</i>
<i> you are clear to land.</i>

1372
01:21:14,069 --> 01:21:16,070
<i> Colonel Lennox</i>
<i> just hit the deck.</i>

1373
01:21:17,339 --> 01:21:20,007
This is Santos,
team leader usa.
What you got?

1374
01:21:23,311 --> 01:21:25,446
<i> Trf airship on the way.</i>

1375
01:21:33,088 --> 01:21:34,288
Meet me around back, bee.

1376
01:21:36,358 --> 01:21:38,092
I suck at this game!

1377
01:21:38,094 --> 01:21:40,160
When you bite your nails,
you give everything away.

1378
01:21:40,228 --> 01:21:42,429
Mum?

1379
01:21:42,431 --> 01:21:45,132
Everybody, this is Cade.

1380
01:21:45,134 --> 01:21:47,368
Cade, this is my family.

1381
01:21:47,370 --> 01:21:48,636
Hello!

1382
01:21:48,638 --> 01:21:50,137
- Hi.
- Cade?

1383
01:21:50,139 --> 01:21:51,906
Hello. I'm Marie.

1384
01:21:51,908 --> 01:21:53,173
Do you have
a dungeon?

1385
01:21:53,175 --> 01:21:55,242
Oh, my goodness!
Hands like rough old maple.

1386
01:21:55,244 --> 01:21:56,944
He looks hard as wood.

1387
01:21:56,946 --> 01:21:59,246
Don't touch him.
Um, I'm gonna go
and get changed.

1388
01:21:59,248 --> 01:22:02,516
I got a call
from a very irate janitor
at Trinity library.

1389
01:22:03,219 --> 01:22:06,320
<i> We are, as they say,</i>
<i> in a bit of a pickle.</i>

1390
01:22:06,322 --> 01:22:07,922
Do not mess
with me at this moment!

1391
01:22:07,924 --> 01:22:10,190
It's hot, and I am
on a short fuse.

1392
01:22:14,029 --> 01:22:15,195
Quick!
Get to the library!

1393
01:22:15,330 --> 01:22:16,997
This chasing
is stressing me out.

1394
01:22:20,936 --> 01:22:23,203
MI6 and trf
are gonna find us.
We got to hurry.

1395
01:22:23,471 --> 01:22:25,272
My dad had
a lot of stuff.

1396
01:22:27,008 --> 01:22:28,409
So, finding
the staff's location...

1397
01:22:28,411 --> 01:22:30,144
What does that mean?
We're looking for,
like, what?

1398
01:22:30,146 --> 01:22:32,279
Like, a map,
or a letter,
or books, or...

1399
01:22:32,281 --> 01:22:35,149
Holy shit! It'll take a year
to find something in here.

1400
01:22:35,151 --> 01:22:37,384
I don't know
where to find
this bloody staff.

1401
01:22:37,386 --> 01:22:39,019
Look at this
little fake horse.

1402
01:22:39,021 --> 01:22:40,287
Probably stuffed
in its butt or something.

1403
01:22:40,289 --> 01:22:41,355
Guys do stupid stuff
like that.

1404
01:22:43,291 --> 01:22:45,059
What is going on up there?

1405
01:22:46,227 --> 01:22:47,494
You checking
behind pictures?

1406
01:22:47,496 --> 01:22:49,029
Just rip it.
Rip it apart!

1407
01:22:49,965 --> 01:22:51,966
Just grab it. Hurry,
let's make this quick.

1408
01:22:51,968 --> 01:22:55,502
- I can't get it out.
- Oh, wow. Great.

1409
01:22:55,504 --> 01:22:58,472
Oh, my god.
Such a hoarder.

1410
01:23:01,377 --> 01:23:03,177
It's like having
Tarzan in the house.

1411
01:23:03,179 --> 01:23:04,411
Slow down.

1412
01:23:06,014 --> 01:23:07,448
- I'm gonna take a peek.
- No!

1413
01:23:08,216 --> 01:23:10,317
Come on, come on.
Answer me, come on!

1414
01:23:12,754 --> 01:23:14,355
<i> Damn you,</i>
<i>tell me where it is!</i>

1415
01:23:14,357 --> 01:23:17,524
Not so fast. I want in.

1416
01:23:18,460 --> 01:23:20,728
To be a witwiccan,
you have to be
a special person.

1417
01:23:20,730 --> 01:23:24,999
Read me into the club
and I'll tell you.
Right here, now.

1418
01:23:25,001 --> 01:23:28,102
Over the phone?
That is absolutely
barbaric.

1419
01:23:28,104 --> 01:23:30,037
Over the phone.
Do it, englishman!

1420
01:23:30,205 --> 01:23:33,307
As the 12th Earl of folgan,
by the power imbued

1421
01:23:33,409 --> 01:23:36,477
<i> and his league of knights</i>
<i> of the round table,</i>

1422
01:23:36,479 --> 01:23:39,079
<i> I now Grant you,</i>
<i> Seymour rutherford</i>
<i> Simmons...</i>

1423
01:23:39,081 --> 01:23:41,482
Entrance into...
"Admittance," not "entrance"!

1424
01:23:41,484 --> 01:23:43,117
Don't try to snooker me.
Get it right.

1425
01:23:43,119 --> 01:23:45,753
Enough, enough, enough.
Just tell me! Now!

1426
01:23:45,755 --> 01:23:47,087
Shh! Hush!

1427
01:23:47,089 --> 01:23:50,124
Shut up! "Shh"
yourselves.

1428
01:23:50,126 --> 01:23:51,492
What's the matter
with you all?

1429
01:23:51,494 --> 01:23:52,559
Stack six, row c.

1430
01:23:52,561 --> 01:23:57,398
I'm going! I'm going!
It's very confusing
talking to you.

1431
01:23:57,400 --> 01:24:00,300
Come on, Simmons,
you said no work today.

1432
01:24:00,302 --> 01:24:02,770
Let's get your pale-ass legs
and go to the beach.

1433
01:24:02,772 --> 01:24:05,339
I'm working here, all right?
Five minutes, I swear!

1434
01:24:05,341 --> 01:24:07,808
You always say
five minutes.
That means no.

1435
01:24:07,810 --> 01:24:10,444
Just go get
Rodrigo and Julio
and get the game started.

1436
01:24:10,446 --> 01:24:12,112
I hate Rodrigo.

1437
01:24:12,114 --> 01:24:15,215
Okay, come on,
I'm in the middle
of something.

1438
01:24:15,217 --> 01:24:19,586
<i> They knew way back</i>
<i> in the dark ages</i>
<i> where the end would begin.</i>

1439
01:24:20,255 --> 01:24:22,256
There is cybertron
and there is earth.

1440
01:24:22,258 --> 01:24:24,058
Only they don't
call it earth at all,
they never did.

1441
01:24:24,060 --> 01:24:25,159
<i> They called it</i>
<i> something else.</i>

1442
01:24:25,161 --> 01:24:27,227
<i> One will suck</i>
<i> the other dry,</i>

1443
01:24:27,395 --> 01:24:30,464
a giant succubus,
until only one remains.

1444
01:24:31,199 --> 01:24:32,266
Wow.

1445
01:24:33,134 --> 01:24:34,501
Earth is unicron.

1446
01:24:34,503 --> 01:24:38,338
One day his horns
will rise to fight
the mad goddess quintessa.

1447
01:24:38,574 --> 01:24:42,443
<i> She will end our planet</i>
<i> to resurrect her own.</i>

1448
01:24:43,511 --> 01:24:44,545
Let's go. Hurry!

1449
01:24:44,547 --> 01:24:46,080
Oh, my lord.
Cogman, go!

1450
01:24:46,082 --> 01:24:47,414
<i> Tell me where</i>
<i> it goes down.</i>

1451
01:24:47,416 --> 01:24:48,816
I just dropped it to you.

1452
01:24:48,818 --> 01:24:50,684
<i> The horns are the key</i>
<i> to the location.</i>

1453
01:24:51,152 --> 01:24:52,486
<i> Why are they spread out</i>
<i> all over the earth</i>

1454
01:24:52,488 --> 01:24:54,154
<i> in a jumble?</i>
<i> The answer, they aren't.</i>

1455
01:24:54,156 --> 01:24:56,490
Time and mother nature
pulled them apart.

1456
01:24:56,558 --> 01:24:58,258
That's pangaea.
The supercontinent.

1457
01:24:58,260 --> 01:25:00,160
<i> It's the same shape</i>
<i> on the round table.</i>

1458
01:25:00,162 --> 01:25:04,465
at what's smack
in the center
of that perfect circle.

1459
01:25:04,467 --> 01:25:05,566
Genius!

1460
01:25:05,568 --> 01:25:06,633
That's stonehenge!

1461
01:25:06,635 --> 01:25:10,270
No one understood
its purpose until now.

1462
01:25:10,438 --> 01:25:13,307
No one. Except me.
That's where it all begins.

1463
01:25:13,309 --> 01:25:15,342
You're the man
behind the man.
Do something.

1464
01:25:15,344 --> 01:25:17,177
<i> I'll handle it,</i>
<i> brother Simmons, fear not.</i>

1465
01:25:17,179 --> 01:25:18,378
I never had a brother.

1466
01:25:20,248 --> 01:25:21,582
Feels nice.

1467
01:25:21,584 --> 01:25:23,650
Beach time!
Ready? Whoo!

1468
01:25:28,189 --> 01:25:29,656
"Viviane followed Merlin."

1469
01:25:30,892 --> 01:25:32,426
What does that mean?

1470
01:25:32,428 --> 01:25:33,861
My secret cupboard!

1471
01:25:39,134 --> 01:25:40,467
Okay, okay.

1472
01:25:40,469 --> 01:25:42,136
"Viviane followed Merlin."

1473
01:25:42,203 --> 01:25:45,272
Only Merlin could wield
the magic staff.

1474
01:25:46,207 --> 01:25:48,208
Merlin and little girls,
of course.

1475
01:25:52,547 --> 01:25:54,882
Navy museum,
that's got to be
where the staff is.

1476
01:25:54,884 --> 01:25:56,617
Oh, my god,
it was in my hands
all along.

1477
01:26:00,555 --> 01:26:01,688
Alpha team, go, go, go.

1478
01:26:03,224 --> 01:26:05,292
British trf!
Come on!

1479
01:26:06,561 --> 01:26:07,694
I surrender.

1480
01:26:08,930 --> 01:26:11,532
My lord, trf
is on our tail.

1481
01:26:11,666 --> 01:26:13,700
Why'd you park
the decoy car so far away?

1482
01:26:13,702 --> 01:26:15,302
Oh, you are a fusspot!

1483
01:26:16,471 --> 01:26:18,505
Good. Don't let us
get caught, cogman.

1484
01:26:19,607 --> 01:26:21,408
My speciality, my lord.

1485
01:26:39,494 --> 01:26:41,395
Damn! You don't
have to kill people.

1486
01:26:47,936 --> 01:26:49,336
Get out of the way!

1487
01:26:52,440 --> 01:26:54,408
Which reminds me,
Agnes called.

1488
01:26:54,410 --> 01:26:57,344
Wondered if you're available
for a bit of a snuggle
this evening.

1489
01:26:57,679 --> 01:27:00,247
Oh, I'd love a snuggle
with Agnes.
Do I look available?

1490
01:27:10,959 --> 01:27:12,726
Move, bitch!
Get out of my way!
Kamikaze pilot!

1491
01:27:12,728 --> 01:27:14,528
Move, bitch!
Get out of my way!

1492
01:27:15,965 --> 01:27:17,698
Hello. Yes.
Navy museum.

1493
01:27:19,634 --> 01:27:21,835
Royal Navy museum.
I knew it!

1494
01:27:26,708 --> 01:27:28,375
<i> Bee, I'm gonna</i>
<i> divert the cops!</i>

1495
01:27:31,746 --> 01:27:33,347
<i>A decepticon has been seen...</i>

1496
01:27:33,349 --> 01:27:34,615
What do you mean,
decepticon?

1497
01:27:36,317 --> 01:27:38,285
Here's where
it gets intense.
More intense?

1498
01:27:50,465 --> 01:27:51,531
Bee?

1499
01:27:58,406 --> 01:27:59,740
Goddamn,
they're all around us

1500
01:27:59,742 --> 01:28:01,675
and I just have
so much road rage!

1501
01:28:02,010 --> 01:28:03,677
Actualize the rage.
That's it!

1502
01:28:05,480 --> 01:28:07,381
Oh, you want some?

1503
01:28:09,550 --> 01:28:11,318
Cogman, blast them!

1504
01:28:23,631 --> 01:28:24,698
Good boy.

1505
01:28:27,435 --> 01:28:29,303
It's a one-way street!

1506
01:28:29,305 --> 01:28:30,570
I'm not driving.
He's driving.

1507
01:28:32,707 --> 01:28:33,774
No!

1508
01:28:39,080 --> 01:28:40,681
Bee, head right, haul ass!
Go!

1509
01:28:46,688 --> 01:28:47,754
Whoa!

1510
01:28:55,664 --> 01:28:57,731
<i> That's how you get</i>
<i>to the big leagues.</i>

1511
01:29:00,501 --> 01:29:01,868
Oh, that hurt.

1512
01:29:02,570 --> 01:29:05,439
What the hell?
You are out
of your mind!

1513
01:29:09,811 --> 01:29:11,445
Did we lose them?
Hey, stop!

1514
01:29:11,447 --> 01:29:15,482
It's all right, I've got them!
They just love submarines.

1515
01:29:17,619 --> 01:29:20,887
Yes, they are, aren't they?
That's the modern generation.

1516
01:29:21,389 --> 01:29:24,491
And this museum
is closed for eternity.

1517
01:29:24,592 --> 01:29:26,660
All you boys
and girls, off the sub now!

1518
01:29:26,761 --> 01:29:29,596
Off the sub now!
Move, move, move!

1519
01:29:29,598 --> 01:29:31,832
Go on, push!
Move your fat ass!
Push! Squeeze!

1520
01:29:31,834 --> 01:29:32,899
Go, go, go!

1521
01:29:33,835 --> 01:29:35,602
This thing
isn't gonna run.

1522
01:29:35,803 --> 01:29:39,873
The mission's in deep,
unexplored waters.

1523
01:29:40,375 --> 01:29:41,641
It's wonderful!

1524
01:29:41,809 --> 01:29:44,711
And the sour-sweet musk
of men in close quarters.

1525
01:29:44,713 --> 01:29:46,713
It's quite
disgusting, really.

1526
01:29:46,814 --> 01:29:48,382
But now this,

1527
01:29:48,483 --> 01:29:50,450
the greatest mission
of them all,

1528
01:29:50,452 --> 01:29:52,853
one that I have longed for
my entire life...

1529
01:29:53,488 --> 01:29:57,691
To help turn the tide
of human history, you know?

1530
01:29:59,727 --> 01:30:02,396
Now, alas,

1531
01:30:03,564 --> 01:30:05,399
I can no longer join you.

1532
01:30:05,401 --> 01:30:09,669
But, my lord,
you have been waiting
for this moment for 71 years.

1533
01:30:09,671 --> 01:30:12,739
I know, I know, but I'm not
knighthood material,
I'm afraid.

1534
01:30:13,474 --> 01:30:14,641
And, uh...

1535
01:30:14,776 --> 01:30:16,610
You have your mission,
and I have mine.

1536
01:30:16,612 --> 01:30:19,179
Oh, no, no.
You are not leaving
us in this tin can

1537
01:30:19,181 --> 01:30:21,548
with that four-foot
mental psychopath.
I don't think so.

1538
01:30:21,550 --> 01:30:23,683
I prefer
the word "sociopath."

1539
01:30:23,751 --> 01:30:25,719
Mr. Cade, everything
you've done in your life,

1540
01:30:25,721 --> 01:30:27,821
your pain
and your suffering,

1541
01:30:27,823 --> 01:30:30,490
the loss of your wife,
separation from
your daughter,

1542
01:30:30,492 --> 01:30:35,695
it's all just been
a journey to this
very moment.

1543
01:30:38,499 --> 01:30:39,900
You talk a lot.

1544
01:30:41,202 --> 01:30:42,903
Yeah, I suppose I do.

1545
01:30:44,439 --> 01:30:45,539
Um, my dear,

1546
01:30:45,541 --> 01:30:48,909
uh, your father left
the <i> alliance </i> to you,

1547
01:30:49,644 --> 01:30:50,911
for you alone.

1548
01:30:50,913 --> 01:30:52,846
She knows the way
to the staff.

1549
01:30:53,181 --> 01:30:54,848
Good luck to both of you.

1550
01:30:56,217 --> 01:30:58,585
It won't be
the strangest thing
I've done today.

1551
01:30:59,754 --> 01:31:01,054
Oh...

1552
01:31:02,490 --> 01:31:04,024
Hope the old girl's
still got it.

1553
01:31:11,232 --> 01:31:12,599
Good luck!

1554
01:31:12,601 --> 01:31:13,667
Whoa.

1555
01:31:14,669 --> 01:31:15,735
Oh, sh...

1556
01:31:15,837 --> 01:31:16,903
Whoa.

1557
01:31:17,238 --> 01:31:18,939
Okay. I didn't do that.

1558
01:31:19,974 --> 01:31:21,241
Jumped?
What do you mean, jumped?

1559
01:31:21,243 --> 01:31:23,510
The old world war ii sub
jumped its moorings.

1560
01:31:23,512 --> 01:31:25,011
They're in a transformer.

1561
01:31:34,822 --> 01:31:36,790
Can I get a look?
No, I'm looking.

1562
01:31:36,792 --> 01:31:38,258
Will you move?

1563
01:31:38,260 --> 01:31:40,227
God, get out of the way, man!
Is that water?

1564
01:31:40,229 --> 01:31:42,696
No shit, Sherlock.
Obviously, it's water.

1565
01:31:42,698 --> 01:31:43,797
Do you know
how to operate it?

1566
01:31:43,799 --> 01:31:46,633
He says
you're in charge
of this now.

1567
01:31:46,801 --> 01:31:48,835
Let me see. Let me see.
Don't touch me again!

1568
01:31:48,837 --> 01:31:52,639
What happens
in the alien ship
stays in the alien ship.

1569
01:31:52,807 --> 01:31:54,774
I will eff you up!

1570
01:31:56,244 --> 01:31:58,578
<i> Surface, I have</i>
<i> positive surface contact.</i>

1571
01:31:58,580 --> 01:31:59,913
<i> Track number 5205.</i>

1572
01:31:59,915 --> 01:32:01,548
The sub must be heading
for open water,

1573
01:32:01,550 --> 01:32:02,782
directly towards
our strike group.

1574
01:32:02,784 --> 01:32:03,884
Okay, we have
to cut 'em off. Stop 'em.

1575
01:32:03,886 --> 01:32:04,985
Use whatever
assets we have.

1576
01:32:04,987 --> 01:32:06,520
Contact the zulu module.

1577
01:32:06,522 --> 01:32:08,021
Have all our subs
converge on that chokepoint.

1578
01:32:08,589 --> 01:32:10,590
<i> Helm, all ahead flank.</i>

1579
01:32:12,027 --> 01:32:13,693
Conn,
sonar. Alien contact,

1580
01:32:13,695 --> 01:32:15,729
bearing 150,
range 1,000 yards.

1581
01:32:15,731 --> 01:32:17,664
Contact bearing 150.

1582
01:32:23,004 --> 01:32:25,906
We need to get
seal teams in dsvs.
We need to chase 'em.

1583
01:32:29,877 --> 01:32:31,311
Control. Ace one,
going to the bay.

1584
01:32:31,313 --> 01:32:32,679
Ace one, going to the bay.

1585
01:32:45,092 --> 01:32:46,860
Cogman?
Is that normal?

1586
01:32:46,862 --> 01:32:49,829
A nuclear-class
attack submarine
is on our stern.

1587
01:32:49,831 --> 01:32:50,864
What?

1588
01:32:50,866 --> 01:32:52,666
Quick, follow me. Quick.

1589
01:32:52,668 --> 01:32:53,967
It's your sub, not mine.

1590
01:32:54,335 --> 01:32:57,837
My sub? Seven hours ago,
i was just a professor.

1591
01:33:01,876 --> 01:33:02,943
All right,
uncoupling.

1592
01:33:12,620 --> 01:33:15,055
All right, let's move.
Let's move.
Put it in high gear.

1593
01:33:19,060 --> 01:33:20,727
Dsv-2,
stay on our tail.

1594
01:33:20,729 --> 01:33:24,664
Conn, sonar.
Alien contact,
1,000 yards and closing.

1595
01:33:24,666 --> 01:33:26,066
An alarm on a sub
is not a good thing.

1596
01:33:26,068 --> 01:33:27,667
Why did he
send us up here?

1597
01:33:27,669 --> 01:33:29,002
He got us up front
so we die first.

1598
01:33:29,004 --> 01:33:32,072
Warning shot.
Make tube one ready
in all respects.

1599
01:33:32,074 --> 01:33:33,206
Shoot tube one.

1600
01:33:42,049 --> 01:33:44,217
Conn, sonar.
Alien contact going vertical.

1601
01:33:54,830 --> 01:33:55,996
Hold on!

1602
01:34:04,105 --> 01:34:05,772
Conn, sonar.
It's coming back around.

1603
01:34:05,774 --> 01:34:07,674
It's gonna hit us!
Brace for impact!

1604
01:34:08,844 --> 01:34:09,943
Hold on!

1605
01:34:16,984 --> 01:34:18,785
Conn, sonar.
He's going deep!

1606
01:34:18,787 --> 01:34:20,954
We're clear for now.

1607
01:34:21,088 --> 01:34:24,190
Hands off! There is a time
and a place for everything.

1608
01:34:24,192 --> 01:34:26,926
This is not
the time nor the place.

1609
01:34:27,128 --> 01:34:28,795
Hey!
Not now!

1610
01:34:28,797 --> 01:34:30,997
Where are you going?
Away from here.

1611
01:34:34,869 --> 01:34:37,170
That little sicko
just shot himself out
like a torpedo!

1612
01:34:37,172 --> 01:34:39,005
I know! I saw it!

1613
01:34:39,007 --> 01:34:40,273
Those are
your peoples.

1614
01:34:48,015 --> 01:34:51,451
Good afternoon.
Is the, uh,
prime minister in?

1615
01:34:51,453 --> 01:34:52,719
Who?

1616
01:34:52,721 --> 01:34:57,924
Oh, it's urgent, is it?
Why didn't you say so?

1617
01:34:58,759 --> 01:35:00,126
Oh. Thank you.
Dickhead.

1618
01:35:00,128 --> 01:35:02,162
I'll use the old entrance.
Good afternoon.

1619
01:35:02,730 --> 01:35:03,997
Get in there.

1620
01:35:14,743 --> 01:35:17,744
Oh, I just got this thing
that was on my arm

1621
01:35:17,746 --> 01:35:19,179
and it's, like,
just moving all around.

1622
01:35:19,181 --> 01:35:23,249
Yeah. It seems
to not be, um... if you'd...

1623
01:35:23,918 --> 01:35:26,086
It's just sort of slithery...

1624
01:35:26,954 --> 01:35:28,254
Slipping
from the arm to the...

1625
01:35:28,256 --> 01:35:30,490
Yeah, it's coming down.
It's going down
your pants there.

1626
01:35:30,492 --> 01:35:31,958
Careful.
Oh...

1627
01:35:31,960 --> 01:35:34,094
And is it tight
or gripping on?

1628
01:35:34,228 --> 01:35:35,862
It doesn't hurt,
but I don't know
what it does.

1629
01:35:35,864 --> 01:35:37,497
It's like some
worthless alien junk.

1630
01:35:37,499 --> 01:35:39,099
I think the purpose...
I think the...

1631
01:35:39,101 --> 01:35:40,867
We'll find out
what the purpose is.

1632
01:35:41,035 --> 01:35:42,736
If... if you want to.

1633
01:35:44,940 --> 01:35:47,741
Cogman! What is...
What is all this?

1634
01:35:47,743 --> 01:35:51,978
I thought a meal,
a last meal,
would be in order.

1635
01:35:52,079 --> 01:35:54,314
Great. I'm starving.
No canoodling.

1636
01:35:54,915 --> 01:35:55,982
Wait, cogman?

1637
01:35:59,053 --> 01:36:00,820
Yep. My daughter would...
So my grandma said...

1638
01:36:00,822 --> 01:36:01,955
My daughter
would love this.

1639
01:36:01,957 --> 01:36:03,056
My grandma
would absolutely...

1640
01:36:03,058 --> 01:36:05,825
Yeah, I was about to say.
She would love it.

1641
01:36:05,827 --> 01:36:09,262
What does she say?
"Go on a date,
get a boyfriend."

1642
01:36:09,264 --> 01:36:10,897
Is this a date?

1643
01:36:11,265 --> 01:36:14,167
No. God, it's not
a date. No.
It's just that...

1644
01:36:14,169 --> 01:36:15,802
It's romantic.

1645
01:36:17,071 --> 01:36:19,205
Sushi <i> a la </i> cogman!

1646
01:36:19,774 --> 01:36:20,907
Wow! Looks great.

1647
01:36:28,082 --> 01:36:29,849
No sacrifice,

1648
01:36:34,855 --> 01:36:37,023
Is the president
in his bunker?

1649
01:36:37,291 --> 01:36:38,792
He is.

1650
01:36:38,959 --> 01:36:40,326
How about putin?

1651
01:36:41,796 --> 01:36:43,062
Son of a bitch.

1652
01:36:47,067 --> 01:36:48,568
Are you the new
prime minister?

1653
01:36:48,570 --> 01:36:50,804
Security, my office, now!

1654
01:36:50,806 --> 01:36:52,906
Oh, I'm sorry. Well,
i used the old entrance.

1655
01:36:52,908 --> 01:36:55,208
That door is used
for extraordinary
circumstances,

1656
01:36:55,210 --> 01:36:57,310
and these circumstances
are quite extraordinary.

1657
01:36:57,878 --> 01:36:59,913
I will keep this
very simple.

1658
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:01,548
Nasty little fellow.

1659
01:37:01,550 --> 01:37:04,284
I let him out,
we all die
terrible deaths.

1660
01:37:04,286 --> 01:37:05,952
Do you understand?

1661
01:37:07,021 --> 01:37:08,188
Thank you.

1662
01:37:08,289 --> 01:37:10,290
Now, my name
is sir Edmond Burton,

1663
01:37:10,292 --> 01:37:12,992
her majesty's royal Navy,
order of the witwiccans,

1664
01:37:12,994 --> 01:37:15,829
keeper of the secret history
of transformers
here on earth...

1665
01:37:15,831 --> 01:37:17,864
Witwiccans?
Witwiccans, yes.

1666
01:37:19,900 --> 01:37:21,901
But erm, they all died out.

1667
01:37:22,036 --> 01:37:25,338
Not all of them.
Not yet, anyway.

1668
01:37:25,340 --> 01:37:27,907
But I do need you to marshal
all your resources...

1669
01:37:27,909 --> 01:37:31,344
Emerged from
the wall and now...
Let me finish. Let me...

1670
01:37:31,346 --> 01:37:32,979
Shut up!

1671
01:37:36,150 --> 01:37:38,318
Shut up.

1672
01:37:40,054 --> 01:37:42,155
Okay. As I said,
i need you to marshal

1673
01:37:42,157 --> 01:37:44,357
all your resources,
all your military assets.

1674
01:37:44,625 --> 01:37:47,160
Because as you no doubt
have surmised,

1675
01:37:47,162 --> 01:37:48,895
the world is going to end,

1676
01:37:49,063 --> 01:37:51,364
and I know where. And when.

1677
01:37:58,239 --> 01:38:02,141
You are the first
to see this ship
since the dark ages.

1678
01:38:02,276 --> 01:38:07,013
Your talisman is the key
to unlocking this ship.

1679
01:38:20,661 --> 01:38:22,462
Sonar has
about 800 meters.

1680
01:38:25,099 --> 01:38:27,400
I think I got
a bogey at four o'clock.

1681
01:38:27,902 --> 01:38:30,036
<i> We're starting to see it</i>
<i> through the murk.</i>

1682
01:38:31,672 --> 01:38:33,373
<i> There's lights down here.</i>

1683
01:38:34,975 --> 01:38:37,944
Oh, my god. Look at that.
It's a big alien ship.

1684
01:38:38,212 --> 01:38:41,247
<i> Topside, are you</i>
<i> catching this?</i>
<i> It's massive.</i>

1685
01:38:47,187 --> 01:38:48,288
The ship knows
we're here.

1686
01:39:04,939 --> 01:39:06,072
Stay on his tail.

1687
01:39:11,011 --> 01:39:12,078
Oh, shit.

1688
01:39:17,051 --> 01:39:19,085
<i> The door just sealed.</i>

1689
01:39:19,687 --> 01:39:21,521
Try those tubes.

1690
01:39:22,356 --> 01:39:24,357
Dsv-2, stay close.
Stay close.

1691
01:39:25,025 --> 01:39:26,292
<i> Topside, we're going in.</i>

1692
01:39:27,061 --> 01:39:28,962
We're gonna lose
radio contact.

1693
01:39:39,740 --> 01:39:41,274
We're in a current!

1694
01:39:41,276 --> 01:39:42,976
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Steady, steady, steady!

1695
01:39:42,978 --> 01:39:44,544
Use the arms
to keep us...

1696
01:39:47,715 --> 01:39:48,748
Keep control!
Stay off the wall!

1697
01:39:48,750 --> 01:39:50,116
Hold it!
Stay off the wall!

1698
01:40:12,106 --> 01:40:13,172
What now?

1699
01:40:13,407 --> 01:40:14,774
You're the last knight.

1700
01:40:14,776 --> 01:40:19,012
You're the Earl's
special guy.
You figure it out.

1701
01:40:19,480 --> 01:40:21,314
Let's go.

1702
01:40:22,149 --> 01:40:23,516
I'm not going
in that water.

1703
01:40:23,518 --> 01:40:26,619
My gears would be sucked
into my main shaft.

1704
01:40:30,224 --> 01:40:32,492
Now you're both
on my shit list.

1705
01:40:58,819 --> 01:41:00,453
We were blinded.

1706
01:41:00,788 --> 01:41:02,388
Blinded by the sun.

1707
01:41:03,157 --> 01:41:05,425
The planet hid its approach
behind our star.

1708
01:41:05,793 --> 01:41:09,295
It seems to be acting
deliberately.

1709
01:41:33,253 --> 01:41:35,354
Dozens of strikes
currently modeled.

1710
01:41:36,256 --> 01:41:39,158
First impact
will be Alpha station.

1711
01:41:39,160 --> 01:41:40,226
There is no escape pod.

1712
01:41:40,228 --> 01:41:43,229
<i> Earth will follow</i>
<i> two hours later.</i>

1713
01:41:43,397 --> 01:41:46,499
Dominic modeled
potential casualties
in the tens of millions.

1714
01:41:49,169 --> 01:41:50,303
There's two moons!

1715
01:41:50,305 --> 01:41:52,171
There's two moons!

1716
01:41:52,439 --> 01:41:54,340
The world is ending?

1717
01:41:55,309 --> 01:41:57,176
<i> Some are saying that</i>
<i> it's going to be</i>
<i> a global killer.</i>

1718
01:41:57,178 --> 01:41:58,511
<i> Human civilization</i>
<i> as we know it</i>

1719
01:41:58,513 --> 01:42:00,313
<i> will change in 12 hours.</i>

1720
01:42:00,315 --> 01:42:02,682
<i> The destruction, we're told</i>
<i> by experts, will be immense.</i>

1721
01:42:20,167 --> 01:42:21,267
This is unbelievable.

1722
01:42:21,269 --> 01:42:22,368
Yeah,
it is unbelievable.

1723
01:42:22,536 --> 01:42:23,703
What does the old man
want us to do?

1724
01:42:25,639 --> 01:42:27,340
Whoa!

1725
01:42:31,912 --> 01:42:33,546
Bee, go around,
find another way! Come on!

1726
01:42:33,548 --> 01:42:34,881
<i> What?</i>
<i>Are you serious?</i>

1727
01:42:34,883 --> 01:42:37,183
<i>Think I like winding up</i>
<i>in a place like this?</i>

1728
01:42:43,357 --> 01:42:45,391
It wants us
to go this way.

1729
01:42:46,627 --> 01:42:47,693
Whoa.

1730
01:42:47,695 --> 01:42:50,930
Daytrader! Son of a bitch
actually came through
with our ship!

1731
01:42:50,932 --> 01:42:53,533
Excellent.
We are going to england.

1732
01:42:53,535 --> 01:42:55,902
Things are likely
to get nasty. Real nasty.

1733
01:42:55,904 --> 01:42:58,404
Hey, can I come?
He might need me.

1734
01:42:58,605 --> 01:43:02,275
Oh, little lady, hell,
i ain't no earth parent.
Hop aboard.

1735
01:43:02,277 --> 01:43:04,243
Take a field trip
to the front lines.

1736
01:43:04,245 --> 01:43:05,478
Let's go make some noise.

1737
01:43:05,480 --> 01:43:07,313
Let's give 'em hell.

1738
01:43:07,447 --> 01:43:09,182
I'm driving.

1739
01:43:09,683 --> 01:43:12,518
Hey, Cade,
I'm reluctant
to say this to you, but

1740
01:43:12,686 --> 01:43:15,655
I think that you're quite,
you know, brave.

1741
01:43:15,923 --> 01:43:17,423
Is that a compliment?

1742
01:43:18,258 --> 01:43:20,259
You could throw one
back my way.

1743
01:43:20,261 --> 01:43:22,195
Well, that's got
to happen organically.

1744
01:43:22,930 --> 01:43:24,564
I was the first
off the sub.

1745
01:43:31,305 --> 01:43:32,772
Hold it! Hold.

1746
01:43:33,607 --> 01:43:34,807
I think it's here!

1747
01:44:09,343 --> 01:44:10,409
It's a tomb.

1748
01:44:12,347 --> 01:44:16,682
<i> Page five of the safe zone</i>
<i> config procedure.</i>

1749
01:44:17,284 --> 01:44:19,318
<i> Take thrusters to auto.</i>

1750
01:44:20,988 --> 01:44:22,588
It's happening.

1751
01:44:23,323 --> 01:44:24,991
It's in
our atmosphere now.

1752
01:44:24,993 --> 01:44:26,525
<i> Iss is our first hit.</i>

1753
01:44:26,727 --> 01:44:28,628
<i> Progress</i>
<i> manifolds both failed.</i>

1754
01:44:28,630 --> 01:44:30,529
<i> No thrusters available.</i>

1755
01:44:31,331 --> 01:44:33,366
<i> Conjunction is imminent.</i>

1756
01:44:33,667 --> 01:44:36,535
<i> Good luck and godspeed.</i>

1757
01:44:45,480 --> 01:44:46,812
Move in, move in, check up.

1758
01:44:55,489 --> 01:44:56,856
Formality.

1759
01:44:57,691 --> 01:45:00,326
Knights are always
guarding something.

1760
01:45:03,363 --> 01:45:04,430
Hang on. Look at this.

1761
01:45:05,032 --> 01:45:06,299
It's Celtic.

1762
01:45:27,055 --> 01:45:28,654
It's Merlin.

1763
01:45:29,389 --> 01:45:30,589
It's real.

1764
01:45:30,824 --> 01:45:32,358
All of it!

1765
01:45:32,726 --> 01:45:33,893
Wait, what does this say?

1766
01:45:36,730 --> 01:45:38,464
It means,
"no one shall have it."

1767
01:45:38,799 --> 01:45:41,867
Wait a minute.
We came all the way
down here, all this,

1768
01:45:42,669 --> 01:45:44,537
and you're not
gonna open it?

1769
01:45:45,372 --> 01:45:46,539
Of course
I'm going to open it.

1770
01:45:46,640 --> 01:45:48,574
Good. Let's go.

1771
01:45:49,109 --> 01:45:50,910
Ready? Let's do this.

1772
01:46:04,391 --> 01:46:04,590
You got to be kidding me.

1773
01:46:09,096 --> 01:46:10,963
We've come
all this way for this?

1774
01:46:11,631 --> 01:46:13,132
For your ugly
great-great granddad's bones

1775
01:46:13,134 --> 01:46:15,501
in a box
and some stupid stick?

1776
01:46:15,670 --> 01:46:17,937
How are we gonna
save the world with this?

1777
01:46:17,939 --> 01:46:21,374
I could've cut an oak tree
down at my house and...

1778
01:46:21,576 --> 01:46:25,578
The smooth little
romantic accent's
not gonna work right now.

1779
01:46:26,580 --> 01:46:28,714
I'm speechless.
Thank god.

1780
01:46:28,716 --> 01:46:30,149
Maybe someone stole it?

1781
01:46:30,151 --> 01:46:32,518
No, there's something else.
It's got to be here somewhere.

1782
01:46:33,720 --> 01:46:35,855
I didn't come
all this way for nothing.

1783
01:46:36,156 --> 01:46:38,424
The whole world's at stake.

1784
01:46:45,932 --> 01:46:48,634
Guys,
the meters are freaking.

1785
01:46:49,169 --> 01:46:51,937
I got thermals everywhere.
These things, they...

1786
01:46:53,173 --> 01:46:54,874
They could still be alive.

1787
01:46:56,910 --> 01:46:58,978
The hell happened
to you?

1788
01:47:06,887 --> 01:47:09,789
Who has come
for the staff?

1789
01:47:11,758 --> 01:47:13,426
Shoot him! Shoot him!

1790
01:47:17,497 --> 01:47:19,565
Move!
Get out!

1791
01:47:22,903 --> 01:47:24,770
I'm going to distract him.
Get out of here.

1792
01:47:27,507 --> 01:47:29,642
I have the staff!
Hit it!

1793
01:47:37,919 --> 01:47:39,952
Protect the staff.

1794
01:47:45,692 --> 01:47:46,959
Take his eyes out!

1795
01:48:18,558 --> 01:48:20,025
Whoa, who, whoa,
this thing's moving.

1796
01:48:21,561 --> 01:48:22,761
Corner her!

1797
01:48:22,829 --> 01:48:23,896
Hey.

1798
01:48:24,231 --> 01:48:25,698
Drop the weapon.

1799
01:48:27,901 --> 01:48:28,968
Do it!

1800
01:48:32,272 --> 01:48:33,973
You drop it, or I will.

1801
01:48:37,010 --> 01:48:38,511
You don't know
what you're doing,
Lennox. Stop!

1802
01:48:38,513 --> 01:48:39,578
All I want is that weapon!

1803
01:48:39,713 --> 01:48:40,980
Go ahead, shoot me!
No!

1804
01:48:41,681 --> 01:48:43,516
Only I can wield it.

1805
01:48:43,717 --> 01:48:44,783
Go on!

1806
01:48:45,719 --> 01:48:46,785
Do it!

1807
01:48:47,654 --> 01:48:48,921
Shoot me!

1808
01:48:49,055 --> 01:48:50,856
You don't know
what you're doing, Lennox.

1809
01:48:52,559 --> 01:48:53,926
Don't.

1810
01:48:55,630 --> 01:48:57,096
Protect the staff.

1811
01:49:14,748 --> 01:49:17,716
I've come for that staff.

1812
01:49:23,957 --> 01:49:26,692
Optimus...
What are you doing?

1813
01:49:26,960 --> 01:49:28,160
Give it to me.

1814
01:49:28,762 --> 01:49:30,963
It's me, Cade.
We fought together.

1815
01:49:30,965 --> 01:49:35,601
I fight for my own kind!
My own planet!

1816
01:49:35,969 --> 01:49:37,836
Cade?
This isn't you, prime.

1817
01:49:37,838 --> 01:49:40,573
Give me
the staff, human.

1818
01:49:40,941 --> 01:49:42,007
Cade?

1819
01:49:42,776 --> 01:49:44,843
I will kill you.

1820
01:49:44,845 --> 01:49:45,911
Give it to him.

1821
01:49:51,985 --> 01:49:53,052
Now.

1822
01:50:06,933 --> 01:50:09,702
Who dares
to challenge me?

1823
01:50:18,078 --> 01:50:19,345
It's all wrong, bee.

1824
01:50:19,347 --> 01:50:21,013
Something happened.
That is not optimus.

1825
01:50:21,015 --> 01:50:23,649
You got to find him, bee.
Remember zb-7?

1826
01:50:23,651 --> 01:50:25,184
You got to be
that autobot again.

1827
01:50:25,186 --> 01:50:27,786
Look you got
to get back to the sub,
all right? Get out of here.

1828
01:50:27,788 --> 01:50:31,123
Bee's always had my back.
It's my turn to have his. Go.

1829
01:50:31,125 --> 01:50:32,791
All right,
get back to the dsv.

1830
01:50:32,793 --> 01:50:34,927
Let them know
up top that we lost
control of the weapon.

1831
01:50:35,061 --> 01:50:36,762
Roger that, sir.

1832
01:50:36,764 --> 01:50:38,731
You heard him.
Back to the sub!

1833
01:50:38,733 --> 01:50:40,132
We're gonna find him.

1834
01:51:34,154 --> 01:51:35,954
Come on,
we got to get to the top!

1835
01:51:38,892 --> 01:51:41,160
Holy shit. Holy shit.

1836
01:51:42,429 --> 01:51:44,063
We can make it! Come on!

1837
01:51:58,745 --> 01:52:00,779
Watch out,
big wave coming!

1838
01:52:00,914 --> 01:52:02,247
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

1839
01:52:19,466 --> 01:52:22,000
I am Nemesis prime.

1840
01:52:23,103 --> 01:52:25,270
You are nothing!

1841
01:52:31,244 --> 01:52:32,845
Move it!

1842
01:52:32,847 --> 01:52:38,250
<i> Toc, it looks like</i>
<i>we have a surfaced alien ship.</i>

1843
01:52:39,486 --> 01:52:42,020
<i> Lightning 4</i>
<i> has visual on optimus.</i>

1844
01:52:46,493 --> 01:52:48,193
Prime! Prime, stop!

1845
01:52:48,495 --> 01:52:51,363
Prime, you got to stop!
Please! Don't do this!

1846
01:52:52,065 --> 01:52:53,198
Look at me, prime.

1847
01:52:53,500 --> 01:52:55,968
What are you doing?
It's bee!

1848
01:52:55,970 --> 01:52:58,137
Prime! You can't do this.

1849
01:53:33,540 --> 01:53:35,307
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa!

1850
01:53:42,882 --> 01:53:43,982
Prime!

1851
01:53:45,820 --> 01:53:47,219
Stop! No!

1852
01:53:48,021 --> 01:53:52,825
I am Bumblebee,
your oldest friend.

1853
01:53:53,126 --> 01:53:54,393
Optimus,

1854
01:53:55,161 --> 01:53:58,297
I would lay down
my life for you.

1855
01:54:06,339 --> 01:54:09,875
Bumblebee. Your voice.

1856
01:54:10,176 --> 01:54:11,910
I have not heard it

1857
01:54:12,212 --> 01:54:14,847
since cybertron fell.

1858
01:54:28,328 --> 01:54:31,396
What have I done?

1859
01:54:42,275 --> 01:54:45,310
You blew
your chance to kill unicron.

1860
01:54:46,112 --> 01:54:48,380
I knew you couldn't do it.

1861
01:54:49,115 --> 01:54:52,017
Your time is over, prime.

1862
01:54:52,218 --> 01:54:54,353
You failed.

1863
01:54:54,355 --> 01:54:57,890
You turned your back
on cybertron.

1864
01:54:58,291 --> 01:55:01,026
Now you will watch
earth die.

1865
01:55:03,263 --> 01:55:04,329
No!

1866
01:55:11,004 --> 01:55:12,905
Not going so well.

1867
01:55:24,284 --> 01:55:25,350
Cade!

1868
01:55:30,657 --> 01:55:33,425
You betrayed your own kind.

1869
01:55:33,427 --> 01:55:35,227
No, prime, get up!

1870
01:55:35,229 --> 01:55:37,496
You chose the wrong side.

1871
01:55:37,964 --> 01:55:42,501
The guardian knights
are going to kill me.

1872
01:55:42,969 --> 01:55:45,304
Quintessa
is the great deceiver!

1873
01:55:52,445 --> 01:55:56,081
The judgment is death.

1874
01:56:26,245 --> 01:56:30,215
<i> Seglass ni tonday.</i>

1875
01:56:30,750 --> 01:56:33,251
<i> Seglass ni tonday.</i>

1876
01:56:33,253 --> 01:56:37,022
<i> Seglass ni tonday.</i>

1877
01:56:50,203 --> 01:56:53,372
Cade, I have failed you.

1878
01:56:56,075 --> 01:56:58,076
I have doomed earth.

1879
01:56:59,512 --> 01:57:03,382
Earth, the only place
in the universe

1880
01:57:04,117 --> 01:57:07,185
whose people
let me call it

1881
01:57:08,254 --> 01:57:10,022
home.

1882
01:57:14,093 --> 01:57:16,161
Only you can
make it right, prime.

1883
01:57:17,530 --> 01:57:19,398
I can't do it
without you.

1884
01:57:20,433 --> 01:57:22,501
One moment,
that's all we got.

1885
01:57:23,503 --> 01:57:25,370
It's up to you, prime.

1886
01:57:25,772 --> 01:57:27,072
Because without you,

1887
01:57:27,540 --> 01:57:29,174
we all die.

1888
01:57:32,211 --> 01:57:33,478
It's now or never.

1889
01:57:34,514 --> 01:57:36,281
My brothers,

1890
01:57:36,516 --> 01:57:40,485
I will never
betray you again.

1891
01:57:41,421 --> 01:57:44,322
I am optimus prime.

1892
01:57:44,324 --> 01:57:48,293
To save earth,
we must go to cybertron

1893
01:57:48,394 --> 01:57:51,229
and destroy quintessa.

1894
01:58:14,353 --> 01:58:16,321
The ship is coming.

1895
01:58:16,489 --> 01:58:18,290
It is beautiful.

1896
01:58:30,403 --> 01:58:32,537
Optimus prime gave us
the coordinates
for the endgame.

1897
01:58:32,539 --> 01:58:33,705
It's an ignition chamber.

1898
01:58:34,207 --> 01:58:35,307
<i> The weapon's going up there.</i>

1899
01:58:35,309 --> 01:58:37,409
Get preds
and satellites eyes on.

1900
01:58:37,411 --> 01:58:40,112
Find it and prepare
to engage.

1901
01:58:41,448 --> 01:58:45,150
Eyeball target,
ignition chamber.
We found it.

1902
01:58:45,152 --> 01:58:48,587
- Contact, ignition chamber.
- Target in sight.

1903
01:58:50,123 --> 01:58:51,590
Ignition chamber,
ignition chamber.

1904
01:58:51,592 --> 01:58:53,658
We've got to figure out
what makes it tick.

1905
01:58:54,193 --> 01:58:55,694
We've got to shut it down!

1906
01:58:56,429 --> 01:58:58,330
Come on, come on, come on!

1907
01:58:59,332 --> 01:59:00,565
Good to see you.

1908
01:59:00,567 --> 01:59:02,400
Let's get out of here!
Let's go!

1909
01:59:05,404 --> 01:59:06,905
General, we're gonna prep
a halo jump

1910
01:59:06,907 --> 01:59:08,206
on that ignition chamber.

1911
01:59:08,208 --> 01:59:10,342
Planes will never nav
through those vines.

1912
01:59:10,344 --> 01:59:13,278
Lennox, trust me.
That's our ride right there.

1913
01:59:13,679 --> 01:59:16,314
<i> Our autobot ship.</i>
<i> Put the ospreys in that.</i>

1914
01:59:16,316 --> 01:59:17,549
<i> It'll get us up there.</i>

1915
01:59:17,551 --> 01:59:19,484
<i> Autobot ship's gonna</i>
<i> drop the ospreys.</i>

1916
01:59:19,486 --> 01:59:21,887
<i> They'll virtually</i>
<i> glide to the lz.</i>
<i> It's gonna be high-risk.</i>

1917
01:59:21,889 --> 01:59:24,556
They want to do what
at 20,000 feet?

1918
01:59:24,558 --> 01:59:26,892
Sir, there's this girl.
Woman, actually. Teacher.

1919
01:59:26,894 --> 01:59:29,161
Oxford.
She plays a little Polo.

1920
01:59:29,929 --> 01:59:32,197
Well, that's fantastic.

1921
01:59:32,298 --> 01:59:33,899
<i> They're gonna</i>
<i> break her into the chamber</i>

1922
01:59:33,901 --> 01:59:39,171
Okay, that is
the dumbest idea
you could possibly have!

1923
01:59:39,173 --> 01:59:41,406
<i> Personally, I'm gonna</i>
<i> rely on physics</i>
<i> and mathematics</i>

1924
01:59:41,408 --> 01:59:45,210
<i> not mysticism, fairies,</i>
<i> and some hobgoblins.</i>

1925
02:00:02,528 --> 02:00:04,329
I've lived for this.

1926
02:00:04,331 --> 02:00:06,631
I've lived to kill a planet!

1927
02:00:07,567 --> 02:00:10,702
For our world,
i activate this portal!

1928
02:00:27,520 --> 02:00:28,653
Fire!

1929
02:00:51,244 --> 02:00:53,612
You wretched human!

1930
02:01:12,565 --> 02:01:13,632
Hey!

1931
02:01:18,437 --> 02:01:19,504
Hey.

1932
02:01:21,374 --> 02:01:23,475
You got my message.
You brought everyone here.

1933
02:01:23,477 --> 02:01:24,542
Come on.

1934
02:01:26,746 --> 02:01:27,812
Hey!

1935
02:01:28,447 --> 02:01:30,615
I just found optimus prime!

1936
02:01:31,617 --> 02:01:33,685
He's gonna deal with
all this shit!

1937
02:01:34,287 --> 02:01:36,354
He's gonna save
our asses!

1938
02:01:37,423 --> 02:01:39,424
I brought the troops, man.
I brought the troops.

1939
02:01:40,626 --> 02:01:42,627
Knights, autobots,

1940
02:01:42,762 --> 02:01:46,631
this cannot
and will not be the end.

1941
02:01:48,301 --> 02:01:50,835
To save earth
and her people,

1942
02:01:51,304 --> 02:01:54,472
we are going to steal
quintessa's staff.

1943
02:01:54,807 --> 02:01:57,876
Only you, viviane,
can take it back.

1944
02:01:59,779 --> 02:02:02,480
I will lead the way
into her chamber.

1945
02:02:04,317 --> 02:02:08,453
And when the account
of the ages is etched
into the cosmos,

1946
02:02:08,587 --> 02:02:12,457
let those who exist
long after us know

1947
02:02:12,792 --> 02:02:16,594
that this was
our finest hour.

1948
02:02:22,401 --> 02:02:25,403
Love that guy.
Goosebumps every time.

1949
02:02:25,538 --> 02:02:26,805
I never got to say hi.

1950
02:02:29,675 --> 02:02:31,443
Here they come.

1951
02:02:31,544 --> 02:02:33,111
You think
there's enough?

1952
02:02:33,113 --> 02:02:34,546
No, not even close.

1953
02:02:36,882 --> 02:02:38,817
My lord!
Lord folgan!

1954
02:02:48,828 --> 02:02:50,695
I had it, cogman.

1955
02:02:52,698 --> 02:02:54,432
I had my moment.

1956
02:02:56,135 --> 02:02:57,836
You did, my lord.

1957
02:02:59,572 --> 02:03:01,506
This is the hardest part
of my job.

1958
02:03:02,375 --> 02:03:04,609
Watching folgans die.

1959
02:03:05,644 --> 02:03:07,645
Thank you, cogman.

1960
02:03:08,114 --> 02:03:09,614
Carry on.

1961
02:03:12,986 --> 02:03:17,655
Of all the earls
i have had the pleasure
to serve,

1962
02:03:17,923 --> 02:03:20,525
you were by far
the coolest.

1963
02:03:33,539 --> 02:03:36,541
I have found
your staff of power.

1964
02:03:37,143 --> 02:03:39,544
There is only one
who can hurt us.

1965
02:03:39,779 --> 02:03:42,981
I felt her.
She must not enter.

1966
02:03:43,482 --> 02:03:45,583
My army will stop them.

1967
02:03:46,619 --> 02:03:50,855
Watch as our world heals
and theirs dies.

1968
02:03:51,757 --> 02:03:53,825
A world reborn!

1969
02:04:19,685 --> 02:04:20,985
It's coming.

1970
02:04:35,868 --> 02:04:37,535
It's gonna crush us.

1971
02:04:37,537 --> 02:04:39,537
Get that ship clear
of the crush zone now!

1972
02:04:39,539 --> 02:04:41,673
We got to bail!
Move to the ospreys!

1973
02:04:51,217 --> 02:04:53,685
Move, move, move!
To the ospreys!

1974
02:04:53,687 --> 02:04:54,953
That thing's gonna
roll right over us!

1975
02:05:04,563 --> 02:05:05,630
Move!

1976
02:05:17,276 --> 02:05:20,278
<i> Preliminary numbers</i>
<i> are starting to come in.</i>

1977
02:05:20,280 --> 02:05:24,549
<i> Literally scraping away</i>
<i> cities. Millions will die.</i>

1978
02:05:37,997 --> 02:05:39,998
It's using earth's
geothermal energy

1979
02:05:40,000 --> 02:05:41,900
<i> to reconstitute,</i>
<i> to rebuild itself,</i>
<i> all right?</i>

1980
02:05:41,902 --> 02:05:45,069
<i> If our core cools,</i>
<i> which is rapidly cooling</i>
<i> right now,</i>

1981
02:05:45,071 --> 02:05:47,539
<i>the magnetic field dissolves,</i>
<i>exposing us</i>

1982
02:05:47,673 --> 02:05:49,574
to high levels

1983
02:05:50,075 --> 02:05:51,809
<i>Maybe you'll understand this.</i>

1984
02:05:52,044 --> 02:05:53,878
<i> The earth becomes</i>
<i> a microwave.</i>

1985

1988
02:06:13,766 --> 02:06:15,567
Very mean looking.

1989
02:06:15,701 --> 02:06:18,136
Oh, they look
like wusses to me.

1990
02:06:18,771 --> 02:06:20,738
<i> No, they all messed up.</i>

1991
02:06:21,307 --> 02:06:23,841
Two minutes!
Hey, two minutes!

1992
02:06:23,943 --> 02:06:25,843
That thing kill
Decepticons?
No.

1993
02:06:26,879 --> 02:06:28,146
We do.

1994
02:06:30,349 --> 02:06:33,851
"A few brave warriors
willing to sacrifice all."

1995
02:06:34,653 --> 02:06:37,021
I told my students
that was bullshit.

1996
02:06:37,122 --> 02:06:38,923
Load out, let's go!

1997
02:06:40,693 --> 02:06:41,793
What are you
doing tomorrow?

1998
02:06:41,795 --> 02:06:43,127
Are you asking me
that now?

1999
02:06:43,129 --> 02:06:44,195
Yeah, I am.

2000
02:06:44,697 --> 02:06:46,998
No plans? Good.

2001
02:06:47,866 --> 02:06:49,033
Get in the plane.

2002
02:06:49,802 --> 02:06:51,769
Let's go, let's go!
Let's step it up!

2003
02:06:51,870 --> 02:06:54,138
Strap in.
It's gonna be a rough ride.

2004
02:06:54,140 --> 02:06:55,773
Tighter.
I'm gonna hook you up.

2005
02:06:55,775 --> 02:06:57,141
Pull it down tight, right?
Just this one?

2006
02:06:57,143 --> 02:07:02,113
Pull? Just pull it?
You just pull it
as hard as you can?

2007
02:07:02,948 --> 02:07:04,015
Are you all right?

2008
02:07:04,017 --> 02:07:07,385
Can I borrow your cell phone?
I've got to text my daughter.

2009
02:07:07,387 --> 02:07:08,653
Thanks.

2010
02:07:16,395 --> 02:07:17,662
All right.

2011
02:07:17,896 --> 02:07:19,163
Thank you.

Good luck.

2018

Thirty seconds to drop!

2019
02:07:55,868 --> 02:07:57,802
Those birds better be
softening our target.

2020
02:07:57,804 --> 02:07:59,737
You're not giving me
that warm,
fuzzy feeling, Lennox.

2021
02:08:00,039 --> 02:08:01,873
The osprey's
flight ceiling
is 12,000 feet.

2022
02:08:01,875 --> 02:08:05,009
The air's too thin,
the rotor's got no grab.

2023

We're gonna be
coming in hard.

2024
02:08:06,979 --> 02:08:09,080
It's all bad news.
Oh, yeah.

2025
02:08:11,785 --> 02:08:12,950
All good, yeager?

2026
02:08:13,152 --> 02:08:14,819
You got something to say?

2027
02:08:15,087 --> 02:08:17,021
You and your guys
never stopped hunting me.

2028
02:08:17,122 --> 02:08:19,190
Orders.
You were with them.

2029
02:08:20,993 --> 02:08:22,860
I believed in
one of the great ones.

2030
02:08:22,862 --> 02:08:25,163
Optimus prime.
And his crew.
I never lost faith.

2031
02:08:25,931 --> 02:08:28,032
You did.
The whole world did.

2032
02:08:28,167 --> 02:08:29,901
Now you want
to fly with me.

2033
02:08:32,004 --> 02:08:35,073
Well, I appreciate you guys
making the trip. Thank you.

2034
02:08:41,046 --> 02:08:42,246
Get that staff,

2035
02:08:43,482 --> 02:08:45,083
we all go home.

2036
02:08:51,790 --> 02:08:53,925
<i>Lennox, your team is to hold.</i>

2037
02:08:53,927 --> 02:08:55,460
<i> Strike fighters</i>
<i> are getting shot down.</i>

2038
02:08:55,462 --> 02:08:59,230
Oh. No, it's now or never.
Pilots, go now! Go!

2039
02:08:59,232 --> 02:09:00,798
Hang on!

2040
02:09:01,100 --> 02:09:02,200
<i> Chihuahua.</i>

2041
02:09:02,202 --> 02:09:04,869
What are you doing here?
I don't know.

2042
02:09:05,070 --> 02:09:06,871
But you said
we were family.

2043
02:09:06,873 --> 02:09:09,741
No, I didn't mean...
We got to get her
off here now.

2044
02:09:10,242 --> 02:09:11,843
It was probably
a bad idea.

2045
02:09:17,983 --> 02:09:19,817
<i> Six birds out of the nest.</i>

2046
02:09:19,819 --> 02:09:21,185
Whoo-hoo!

2047
02:09:26,259 --> 02:09:29,060
<i> Push the target,</i>
<i> push the target.</i>

2048
02:09:32,999 --> 02:09:36,234
<i> Chihuahua.</i>
It's okay.
It's okay.

2049
02:09:46,245 --> 02:09:48,513
<i> All fast</i>
<i> movers, distract, distract.</i>

2050
02:09:48,515 --> 02:09:50,248
<i> Keep those enemies</i>
<i> away from the ospreys!</i>

2051
02:09:50,516 --> 02:09:52,183
Bogeys dead ahead!

2052
02:09:57,156 --> 02:09:59,924
<i> Control,</i>
<i>spread it out, spread it out.</i>

2053
02:10:04,898 --> 02:10:08,199
Those fighters
better distract
those enemy ships!

2054
02:10:11,036 --> 02:10:13,204
<i> I got</i>
<i> bogeys coming in hot,</i>
<i> one o'clock.</i>

2055
02:10:18,110 --> 02:10:19,210
<i> I got three bogeys.</i>

2056
02:10:22,548 --> 02:10:24,081
Watch the rotor!

2057
02:10:27,152 --> 02:10:28,920
Sir, bird three
just went down!

2058
02:10:49,107 --> 02:10:51,075
There's our landing zone.

2059
02:10:53,312 --> 02:10:55,012
Take that big gun out.

2060
02:10:56,582 --> 02:10:58,850
Viper flight,
focus on that gun.

2061
02:11:05,624 --> 02:11:07,291
Hold on, we're going down!

2062
02:11:07,293 --> 02:11:09,927
<i> Don't slide off</i>
<i> the edge!</i>

2063
02:11:09,929 --> 02:11:11,195
<i> Brace, brace, brace!</i>

2064
02:11:12,397 --> 02:11:14,265
<i> Two's down, two's down.</i>

2065
02:11:24,176 --> 02:11:25,309
Brace for impact!

2066
02:11:34,052 --> 02:11:36,420
- Out of the bird!
- Grab a buddy!

2067
02:11:39,091 --> 02:11:40,258
Get out
of the bird! Go!

2068
02:11:41,193 --> 02:11:42,293
Back up. Hurry up, back up.

2069
02:11:47,032 --> 02:11:48,099
Enemy fighters!

2070
02:12:24,469 --> 02:12:27,071
That gun emplacement
is tearing us apart!

2071
02:12:31,276 --> 02:12:34,211
There's the ignition
chamber, dead ahead!

2072
02:12:38,684 --> 02:12:40,484
<i> Air cover</i>
<i> not coming. Unable.</i>

2073
02:12:43,455 --> 02:12:45,022
Whoo-hoo!

2074
02:12:45,024 --> 02:12:46,290
Let's ride, bee!

2075
02:12:46,292 --> 02:12:47,491
Let's kick ass!

2076
02:12:54,499 --> 02:12:57,034
Push right to the crater!
Let's go!

2077
02:13:07,479 --> 02:13:09,547
Pinned down
with the hound!

2078
02:13:11,984 --> 02:13:13,751
No way. Where's optimus?

2079
02:13:13,753 --> 02:13:15,586
They said
he never made it.

2080
02:13:16,188 --> 02:13:17,755
We got
the big gun on us!

2081
02:13:17,757 --> 02:13:19,390
We're pinned down!

2082
02:13:21,026 --> 02:13:23,127
Negative to target.
Unable to advance.

2083
02:13:25,497 --> 02:13:27,465
- Get back here, Izzy!
- Izzy!

2084
02:13:27,467 --> 02:13:28,766
I'll be right back!

2085
02:13:28,768 --> 02:13:31,369
It's just a cluster
effin' thingamabob!

2086
02:13:37,142 --> 02:13:39,176
Sqweeks! Hey, hey...

2087
02:13:39,178 --> 02:13:41,412
Look, I need you
to blow that gun up!

2088
02:13:43,750 --> 02:13:47,084
You're small
and you're ugly. No one's
gonna see you coming.

2089
02:13:48,787 --> 02:13:50,521
Blow it up!

2090
02:13:56,795 --> 02:13:58,496
Infernocus,

2091
02:13:58,764 --> 02:14:01,298
transform. Kill them!

2092
02:14:06,538 --> 02:14:08,572
I don't have enough ammo
for that thing.

2093
02:14:09,074 --> 02:14:10,341
I got him!

2094
02:14:27,527 --> 02:14:30,094
Bee and hot rod
are down! Autobots down!

2095
02:14:30,096 --> 02:14:31,262
Where's prime?

2096
02:14:31,264 --> 02:14:34,365
<i> It's a no-go,</i>
<i> general.</i>
<i> We're pinned down!</i>

2097
02:14:34,367 --> 02:14:36,834
<i> Yeah, well, that hobgoblin</i>
<i> stuff didn't work, did it?</i>

2098
02:14:36,836 --> 02:14:39,270
<i> I got a hail Mary.</i>
<i> How about physics?</i>

2099
02:14:39,405 --> 02:14:42,540
It's like if Tiger Woods
was making a big divot

2100
02:14:42,542 --> 02:14:43,574
with his nine-iron.

2101
02:14:43,576 --> 02:14:45,109
Stu, out! Come on, man.

2102
02:14:45,111 --> 02:14:49,814
<i>You gotta blow up those vines,</i>
<i>use tactical nukes to blow out</i>

2103
02:14:49,816 --> 02:14:51,282
the vines and let it swing.

2104
02:14:51,284 --> 02:14:52,349
<i> Okay, you let gravity</i>
<i> do the rest.</i>

2105
02:14:52,351 --> 02:14:55,352
the energy transfer stops,
and the earth is saved.

2106
02:14:55,354 --> 02:14:56,420
You're welcome.

2107
02:14:56,621 --> 02:14:58,823
I need tac-nuke authority.

2108
02:14:58,825 --> 02:15:01,325
<i> Lennox team,</i>
<i> we are pulling you out.</i>
<i> Mission's over.</i>

2109
02:15:01,327 --> 02:15:03,294
<i> Laze targets for incoming</i>
<i> strike fighters.</i>

2110
02:15:03,296 --> 02:15:04,495
<i> Then I'm ordering you</i>
<i> to bail.</i>

2111
02:15:04,497 --> 02:15:05,663
Roger that. Picture's up.

2112
02:15:06,264 --> 02:15:08,165
I see it, I see it.

2113
02:15:08,400 --> 02:15:11,368
We got a new target!
Three o'clock high!

2114
02:15:11,570 --> 02:15:14,305
Laze the new target
for incoming birds.

2115
02:15:14,307 --> 02:15:15,840
They're gonna bring
that whole thing down on us.

2116
02:15:15,842 --> 02:15:17,341
Hey! We're not giving up
on prime, okay?

2117
02:15:17,343 --> 02:15:20,845
They just changed
the whole plan.
We can't get inside.

2118
02:15:20,847 --> 02:15:23,114
What?
The operation is over.

2119
02:15:23,215 --> 02:15:24,315
We stay, we're dead.

2120
02:15:24,317 --> 02:15:27,151
Everybody, grab your chutes,
we're bailing!

2121
02:15:31,256 --> 02:15:32,323
<i> ...you.</i>

02:15:41,334 --> 02:15:42,399
<i> Fight's on.</i>

2124
02:15:48,407 --> 02:15:50,341
Good job, little friend.

2125
02:15:50,343 --> 02:15:52,710
- Laze the target!
- Move, move, move!

2126
02:15:54,213 --> 02:15:58,149
Let's move out!
We got you covered! Move!

2127
02:16:02,888 --> 02:16:04,421
Optimus.

2128
02:16:07,226 --> 02:16:08,292
Yeah!

2129
02:16:27,179 --> 02:16:29,547
You ugly mess!

2130
02:16:32,617 --> 02:16:35,753
Did you forget who I am?

2131
02:16:46,498 --> 02:16:49,466
I am optimus prime.

2132
02:16:49,634 --> 02:16:52,469
Autobots, attack!

2133
02:17:01,246 --> 02:17:02,680
Laze the target!

2134

Go!

2139
02:17:16,995 --> 02:17:19,597
Come on, let's go
i don't think
i can do this.

2140
02:17:20,732 --> 02:17:21,999
Nine seconds.

2141
02:17:22,001 --> 02:17:23,634
We're going home, Izzy.

2142
02:17:25,437 --> 02:17:27,371
<i>Mademoiselle, </i> don't go!

2143

Where is viviane?

2144
02:17:29,342 --> 02:17:31,642
She's gone, boss.
They're all chickening out.

2145
02:17:31,743 --> 02:17:34,011
What if you're wrong,
Lennox? What if
it doesn't work?

2146
02:17:34,013 --> 02:17:35,279
It's gonna work!

2147
02:17:35,281 --> 02:17:37,548
Look, we're doing
this together, okay?

2148
02:17:37,550 --> 02:17:40,517
Here we go.
Hit it, hit it, hit it...

2149
02:17:47,993 --> 02:17:51,362
We got to go!
We're bailing.

2150
02:17:51,463 --> 02:17:53,664
What are you doing?
It's just dusty old books.

2151
02:17:53,666 --> 02:17:54,732
What?

2152
02:17:57,335 --> 02:17:58,602
Wait!

2153
02:17:58,604 --> 02:18:00,638
She's got to be
kidding me. Shit!

2154
02:18:16,688 --> 02:18:19,056
Viviane! Get in here!

2155
02:18:19,058 --> 02:18:20,557
Yes!
My little lady.

2156
02:18:35,373 --> 02:18:36,774
Aah! Wait!

Command, be advised,
ignition chamber
is tumbling.

2159
02:18:53,058 --> 02:18:55,459
I repeat, chamber is broke
loose. It is falling.

- Hold on!

2167

Follow me.

Oh, we're going
weightless. Weightless!

2179
02:21:20,872 --> 02:21:22,639
Grab my hand.
Yes!

2180
02:21:32,550 --> 02:21:33,817
Don't let it go!

2181
02:21:39,824 --> 02:21:42,860
Quintessa,
get off our planet!

2182
02:21:43,628 --> 02:21:45,662
You traitor!

2183
02:21:48,600 --> 02:21:50,834
Say hello to my friend,

2184
02:21:51,569 --> 02:21:53,570
Bumblebee.

2185
02:21:59,277 --> 02:22:01,678
Sting like a bee.

2186
02:22:19,297 --> 02:22:20,931
I'll save you!

2187
02:22:26,971 --> 02:22:28,605
I stop the time.

2188
02:23:36,874 --> 02:23:38,842
Is it tomorrow yet?

2189
02:23:43,381 --> 02:23:45,983
<i> At the heart</i>
<i> of every legend,</i>

2190
02:23:46,351 --> 02:23:48,085
<i> there is truth.</i>

2191
02:23:49,921 --> 02:23:52,689
<i> A few brave souls unite</i>

2192
02:23:53,391 --> 02:23:55,692
<i> to save their worlds.</i>

2193
02:23:56,394 --> 02:23:59,096
<i> We can be heroes</i>
<i> in our own lives,</i>

2194
02:24:00,732 --> 02:24:01,999
<i> every one of us,</i>

2195
02:24:02,367 --> 02:24:06,670
<i> if we only have</i>
<i> the courage to try.</i>

2196
02:24:07,105 --> 02:24:09,172
You saved prime.

2197
02:24:10,675 --> 02:24:13,877
<i> Our fates</i>
<i> were always intertwined.</i>

2198
02:24:14,078 --> 02:24:18,815
<i> But now our worlds</i>
<i> are joined as one.</i>

2199
02:24:19,417 --> 02:24:21,918
<i> We need to repair</i>
<i> our planets.</i>

2200
02:24:22,720 --> 02:24:24,187
<i> Work together...</i>

2201
02:24:24,189 --> 02:24:26,923
<i> If we wish to survive.</i>

2202
02:24:27,959 --> 02:24:29,860
Crazy family, huh?

2203
02:24:31,863 --> 02:24:34,264
You did good, bro.
Real good.

2204
02:24:36,934 --> 02:24:41,238
<i> A dangerous secret</i>
<i> is buried</i>
<i> deep inside the earth.</i>

2205
02:24:42,073 --> 02:24:46,176
<i> There is more to this planet</i>
<i> than meets the eye.</i>

2206
02:24:47,178 --> 02:24:49,813
<i> I am optimus prime,</i>

2207
02:24:50,415 --> 02:24:52,949
<i> calling all autobots.</i>

2208
02:24:53,918 --> 02:24:55,886
<i> It is time</i>

2209
02:24:56,421 --> 02:24:58,689
<i> to come home.</i>

2210
02:25:49,006 --> 02:25:50,207
Are you lost?

2211
02:25:53,745 --> 02:25:55,245
I wouldn't do that.

2212
02:25:56,114 --> 02:25:58,081
Don't touch him.

2213
02:25:59,083 --> 02:26:00,917
He doesn't like it.

2214
02:26:01,486 --> 02:26:03,153
Who doesn't like what?

2215
02:26:04,522 --> 02:26:06,156
Unicron.

2216
02:26:07,191 --> 02:26:09,359
But I could show you
how to kill him.
